  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Active against M. luteus (MIC 5 uM), E. coli D22 (MIC 15 uM), Filamentous fungi N. grassa (MIC 20 uM), and A. fumigatus (MIC 80 uM). Also active against Group A Streptococcus (MIC 75 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 50 uM), E. coli O29 (MIC 30 uM), A. niger (MIC 20 uM), A. fumigatus (MIC 20 uM), and T. rubrum (MIC 75 uM). Inactive: S.aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC>100 uM, but it inhibits the mprF mutant at 20 uM (Radek et al., 2008). This sequence is highly conserved across species. There are three single nucleotide polymorphisms: G364S, P370L, and R374Q. The G364S and R374Q mutants are inactive while the P370L mutant is more active than the WT. Radek et al. established that this peptide is upregulated upon injury of skin and is part of cutaneous immune systems. It can induce mast cell migration, degranulation and production of cytokines and chemokines (Aung G et al 2011 Immunology 132:527-39). The peptide is also antioxidant, thereby preventing free radical-induced DNA damage (Mohseni S et al., 2014). Updated 9/11; 4/2014; 7/2021; 4/2022 GW",
