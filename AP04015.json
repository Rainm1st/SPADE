  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (92.31%) toMyxinidin 3KR: 25%; G=I: 17%.Activity: active against E. coli ATCC 11219 (MIC 2 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 13388 (MIC 2 uM), S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028 (MIC 1.2 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC 10031 (MIC 3 uM), S. aureus ATCC 6538 (MIC 2.2 uM).SAR: N-ternimal acetylation reduced activity against S. aureus.Toxicity: human RBC (5%), 5% hemolysis at 200 uM (HC50> 200 uM, low hemo.lytic).Structure: helical in 50% TFE. The 3D structure was determined in SDS micelles and lipid bicelles. Similar helical structures were found although it was less well defined in bicelles due to reduced NOE restrainst (Cherniavskyi et al., 2024).",
