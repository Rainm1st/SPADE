    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (75%) toKR-12K: 33%, I=R: 17%.Activity: weakly active against S. Gordonii (MIC 96.7 uM). Warning: other bacteria not tested. It inhbited formation of biofilms:bacteria. It suppressed LPS-induced IL-6 similarly to KR-12.",
