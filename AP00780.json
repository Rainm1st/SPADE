    "Literature": "C-terminal NH2. A human milk fraction was active against S. mutants, B. subtilis, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli (MIC 32 ug/ml). It also exhibits growth stimulating activity in 3T3 cell line (Mandal SM et al. 2014). not as active as bovine lactoferricin (bacteria?). Different frombovine lactoferricin, which contains a beta sheet, human lactoferrin consists of a central helix flanked with non-alpha-beta structure.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. It also has anticancer activity by targeting phophatidylserine (PS)Riedl S et al., 2014. Updated Feb/2014; 9/2014; 3/2015.",
