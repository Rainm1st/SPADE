    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (64.52%) toVicBacP: 20%; R: 25%. a Pro-rich like peptide. Possibly disulfide bond formation.  Mol. Wt: 2346.821; GRAVY: -1; Mol Formula: C106H176N40O21; mol ex coeff: 0. Spampcin is likely an AMP with 153 amino acids (no activity is known). However, the fragment is active.Activity: active against Gram+ S. aureus (MIC 12-24 uM), L. monocytogenes (MIC 24-48 uM), E.faecalis (MIC >96 uM), E.faecium (MIC >96 uM), S. epidermidis (MIC 6-12 uM), Gram- P. aeruginosa (MIC 12-24 uM), E. coli (MIC 12-24 uM), A. baunmannii (MIC 3-6 uM), fungi C. neoformans (MFC 24-48 uM), F. graminearum (MFC 12-24 uM), F. solani (MFC 12-24 uM), A. niger (MFC 12-24 uM). Compared to Spa31, this further shortened peptide became less active against numerous strains. Jan2023",
