    "Literature": "Discovery: homologous cecropin screening of the representative transcriptomes from the 1000 Insect Transcriptome Evolution (1KITE) dataset based on known cecropins from the APD and NCBI. Total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed into cDNA.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (81.58%) toPapiliocinpI 11.6; GRAVY: -0.162; Mol Wt:4030.854; Mol formula: C183H316N57O44; Mol Ex coeff: 5550.Activity: active against Gram- E. coli ATCC25922 (MIC 8 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa CGMCC 1.10712 (MIC 32 ug/ml), but not Gram+ M.luteus ATCC9341 (MIC >128 uM) and S.aureus ATCC6538 (MIC > 128 ug/ml). Activity against E. coli also observed in zone inhibition (20 ug peptide).Toxicity: sheep RBC (4%): 6.37% hemolysis at 50 ug/ml.Structure: helical in SDS or 50% TFE.MOA:bacteria: membrane permeation.
