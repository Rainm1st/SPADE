    "Literature": "Discovery: This isolated peptide corresponds to the C-terminal 15 amino acids of calgranulin C, a S100 protein.Activity: pH-sensitive: At pH 7.4, it was not active. At pH 5.4, the peptide was active against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and C. albicans but not S.aureus.  Antibacterial activity is enhanced in the presence of Zn2+ (micromolar) against E. coli and L. monocytogenes but not C. albicans. In human nasal fluids, Zn2+ concentrations range from not detected to 12.8 uM. The latter is sufficient to enhance the activity of the peptide.Biophysical:  Based on isothermal titration calorimetry, Zn(II) binds calcitermin with micromolar affinity while Cu(II) binds at nanomolar affinity. Recently, potentiometric titration, mass spectrometry, UV-Vis absorption and NMR have been employed to study metal binding. Histidine residues (H9, H11, H13) are crucial for Zn2+ and Cu2+ coordination. Terminal amine contributes to Cu2+ binding, but not Zn2+ (Bellotti et al., 2019).Structure:  CD spectroscopy measurements: random coil in PBS, but helical in 50% TFE or 10 mM SDS.
