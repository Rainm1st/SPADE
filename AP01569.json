  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "The sequence of chain B (enterocin Xbeta) is IAPIIVAGLGYLVKDAWDHSDQIISGFKKGWNGGRRK. Antibacterial activities of this AMP were evaluated individually as well as in combination. The individual peptide chains showed weak to moderate activities with MIC at 50 to 800 nM against Enterococcus, Lactococcus, Staphylococcus strains. Different from other two-chain bacteriocins, the activities of these two peptides varied (i.e. not always enhanced) when combined. This is the first documentation of such variations.",
