    "Literature": "Activity: Active against S. aureus (MIC 5-10 uM), S. epidermidis (MIC 2.5-10 uM), E. faecalis (MIC 20 um), A. baumannii (10-20 uM), S. maltophilia (10-40 uM), E. coli (80 uM), P. aeruginosa (80 uM), and C. albicans (MIC 80 uM).Toxic effects on cancer and normal cells: The peptide is also active against select cancer cell lines (A549, MDA-231, and HT-29 (LC50 6-11.5 uM) and HUVEC (LC50 68 uM).Toxicity:  It is also highly hemolytic (LC50 6.2 uM) (Mechkarska M et al. 2014).Structure:  The peptide is helical in 50% TFE and possesses insulin-releasing activity, thereby promising for treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) (Manzo G et al., 2016).
