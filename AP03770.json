    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (45%) toTemporin-SHa. V=F: 15%. Discovered from the human unconventional myosin 1h protein by computer prediction.Activity: active against S. aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC 32 uM), S. epidermidis (MIC 21 uM), and C. albicans (MIC 32 uM). Inactive: T.rubrum (MIC 256 uM).Toxicity: human RBC: HC50 >128 uM. not hemo.lytic.Structure: it became helical after binding to lipids such as DMPG (88.6%) or DMPC (92.9%).  Updated 8/2019; 7/2021",
