  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "A tryptophan-and Pro-rich anticoccidial (antiparasital) peptide selected from phage display libraries.Activity: activity against E. acervulina and E. tenella sporozoites (parasites). Active against  fungi C. albicans (MIC 12.5-25 ug/ml) and A. nidulans (MIC 25-50 ug/ml). inactive against E.coli (MIC>125 uM), S.aureus (MIC>125 uM), M.luteus (no effect at 200 ug/ml) (see ref for Pac-525).Structure:  NMR structure was determined in SDS micelles (Tinoco et al. 2002 J Biol Chem. 277:36351-6). W7, K4, Y6, W8, and R9 are important for membrane binding. The packing between the side chains of W8 and R9 is remarkable, leading to aromatic-pi interactions. This WW+ motif was also observed in other sequences in the library.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Toxicity: 100 ug/ml peptide showed <2% hemo.lytic of human, rabbit, and chicken RBC.
