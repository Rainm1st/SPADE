  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "In DPC micelles, the cationic and hydrophilic N-terminal half of the peptide forms an S-shaped beta-sheet-like domain stabilized by a disulfide bridge and a few hydrogen bonds. This domain is followed by a helix-hinge-helix motif: a hydrophilic 6-mer helix (residues 19-24) and an amphiphilic/hydrophobic 11-mer helix (residues 29-39).  Creating a second S-S bond at the C-terminal region increases biological activity and structural stability.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. Updated 2/2014.",
