  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: At 10 ug/ml, it killed 100% E. coli and 77% S. aureus. Active against E. coli (MIC 3.6 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa, L. monocytogenes (MIC 7 ug/ml),  S. aureus, and B. anthracis spores and bacilli(this ref;Yang et al., 2003).  Also, recombinant CXCL10 inhibits C. albicans. To combat C. albicans, it can also recruit NK cells via a G-protein-coupled receptor CXCR3 (Liu et al., 2014). In addition, CXCL10 is also active against parasite L. mexicana in vitro (SÃ¶birk SK et al 2013).MOA: The interferon-inducible, ELR(-) chemokine CXCL10 kills the Gram-positive pathogen B. anthracis through two independent mechanisms: (1) deregulation of peptidoglycan turnover through interaction with the bacterial FtsE/X complex, which does not require the CXCL10 C-terminal alpha-helix, and (2) through membrane disruption by the C-terminal alpha-helix, which does not need the FtsE/X complex (Margulieux KR et al., 2016). These mechanisms nicely illustrate the antimicrobial units in the same protein scaffold.Structure:You can rotate, zoom, and view the crystal structureherein the PDB.Synthetic derivatives: using overlapping peptides, it is confirmed that both N-terminal fragment and the helical region can kill bacteria. However, only the N-terminal fragment kills B. anthracis (see AP03564 and AP03565). Updated 2/2014; ref.7/2014; 5/2016; 7/2017; 7/2021; 12/2022",
