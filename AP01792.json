  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Probably the first AMP from Scorpion.Activity: Active against B. subtilis (MIC 1 uM), K. pneumoniae (MIC ~10 uM). Recombinant form also produced 98% mortality in sexual stages of (rodent malaria P. berghei) at 15 uM and 100% reduction in (human malaria P. falciparum) parasitemia at 5 uM (Carballar-Lejarazú R et al. Cell Mol Life Sci. 2008 Oct;65(19):3081-92).Structure: N-scorpine presented a random coil structure in water and adopted helical folding in the presence of 50% trifluoroethanol (TFE). C-scorpine contains three disulfide bonds with two structural domains: an unstructured N-terminal domain in water that can form a typical secondary alpha-helix structure in 50% TFE and a C-terminal domain with the CS-alphabeta motif (Estefanía López-Giraldo et al., 2022).
