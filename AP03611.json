    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (50.52%) toBjBDR: 13%; A: 11%. GRAVY: -0.55; Mol Wt: 10716.041; Mol formula:  C467H712N140O135S6; mol ex coeff: 23395.Chemical modification: N-terminus is a pyroglutamic acid, while the C-terminus is amidated. In addition, three disulfide bonds are formed: C1-C5, C2-C4, and C3-C6.Activity: active against Alcanivorax sp. 15.5817 (MIC 2.5 uM), Alteromonas sp. 15.5805 (MIC 1.25 uM), Aquimarina sp. LTB 128 (MIC 5 uM), Bacillus sp. 15.5814 (MIC 0.04 uM), Halomonas sp. 15.5829 (MIC 2.5 uM), Marinobacterium sp. 05.091-3T1 (MIC>10 uM), Marinomonas sp. 14.063 (MIC >10 uM), Marinomonas sp. 15.5827 (MIC 2.5 uM), Martellela sp. 15.5818 (MIC 2.5 uM), Pseudoalteromonas sp. 15.5809 (MIC 10 uM), Ruegeria sp. 15.5815 (MIC >10 uM), Shewanella sp. 15.5830 (MIC 1.5 uM), Sulfitobacter sp. 12.141-5T2 (MIC >10 uM), Tenacibaculum sp. 08.072-4T6 (MIC 1.25 uM), and Winogradskyella sp. 08.27-4T1 (MIC 1.25 uM). The inhibited strains are not identical to those affected by Cg-BigDef5, indicating specificity and complentarity.Synergy:AMPs: in addition, it showed strong synergy with Cg-BigDef5 against the Gram-positive Bacillus sp. 15.5814 with an FIC value of 0.35.Antimicrobial robustness: salt-insensitive: antimicrobial assays were tested at 400 mM NaCl (physiological condition).
