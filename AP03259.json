  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (38.5%) toPanurgine 1.Chemical modification: The side chain of alpha and delta carbons of K6 are fused with the six membered ring of W4 (by forming two C-C bonds) into one additional six-membered aliphatic ring. The peptide Tryglysin was named after the tryptophan, glycine, and lysine amino acids that are involved in the macrocycle. This macrocyclic modification is unprecedented, and falls into two classes of universal classification since the two C-C bond involving both backbone and sidechain of lysine.Culture expression: This peptide expression commences in early stationary phase, peaking at late exponential phase at ~1 uM bulk concentration. It retains a relatively high concentration at stationary phase.Activity: Tryglysin A inhibited S. ferus DSM 20646 (++), S. mutans UA159 (++), S. sanguinis ATCC 10556 (++), S. gordonii Challis Bt (+), S. mitis CCUG 31611 (++), S. oralis 108 (++), S. pneumoniae D39 (++), S. agalactiae A909 (++), and S. bovis JB1 (+) (+, mildly inhibited; ++ inhibited).
