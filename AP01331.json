Block early stage infection of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2), (MOA:virus) probabbly by damaging viral envelops (Chianese et al., 2024).SAR: Addition of an acidic residue to the N-terminus disrupted its activity against Gram- bacteria.Structure:You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure bound to SDS micellesherein the PDB. Structures and molecular dynamics of analogs have also been studied (Crusca E et al., 2017).Updated 4/2014; 4/2016; 4/2017; 6/2019; 7/2021; 9/2023; 7/2024",
