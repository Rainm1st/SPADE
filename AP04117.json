    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (88.89%) toApidaecin IBP:33%; R: 22%; N: 11%.Chemical modification: N-terminal coupled with N,N,N=,N=-tetramethylguanidino group (Gu); warning: N-terminal ornithine is represented as K; C-terminal amidation.Activity:  active against E. coli BL21 AI (MIC 0.5 ug/ml).Half-life in vitro:serum:mouse: half life in serum(25%): 10 min; undiluted mouse serum: 5 min.SAR: Api137: the peptide without C-terminal amidation showed the same MIC against E. coli BL21 (MIC 0.5 ug/ml).In vivo PK:mice:IP: half-life 33.8 min injected at 5 mg/kg and 16.9 min injected at 20 mg/kg, longer than Api88 (11.1-17.1 min) (Schmidt et al., 2017).  IV injection 20 mg/kg: highest plasma conc at 23 mg/L with t1/2 < 30 min. However, s.c. infusion over 1 h at 19.2 mg/kg/h led to stable plasma level of ~6 mg/L, which is above MIC (?).APi134: A change of the R close to the C-end to ornithine led to Api134 with sligtly reduced activity (MIC 2 ug/ml).APi155: A change of the same R to homoR had the MIC of 2 ug/ml.Api161: attaching a C3H7 group to C-terminal amide of Api88 (MIC 4 ug/ml);Api162: attaching a CH3 group to C-terminal amide of Api88 (MIC 4 ug/ml);",
