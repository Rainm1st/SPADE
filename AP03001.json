  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 53.8% similarity toEpinephelus coioides piscidin 4Mol Wt:  2532.938; GRAVY: -0.26, mol formula: C120H177N37O24; mol ex.: 11100; pI 12.3; hydrophobic moment: 0.50. Predicted to be helical by the APD.Activity:   Active against Gram- E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 6.25 ug/mL), P. aeruginosa ATCC10662 (MIC 50 ug/mL), A. baumannii clinical isolate (MIC 6.25 ug/mL), Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 25923 or MRSA (MIC 3.1 ug/mL), S. epidermidis ATCC 1435 (MIC 1.6 ug/mL), and fungi C. albicans (MIC 6.2 ug/ml), C. tropicalis (MIC 6.2 ug/ml). Inactive: C.glabrata clinical isolate (MIC >100 ug/ml). Bacterial killing kinetics is similar to moronecidin. In addiiton, this peptide inhibited bacterial attachment and biofilm formation in a dose-dependent manner.Antimicrobial robustness: Physiological salts had no effect on MIC against E. coli (salt-insensitive): NaCl-insensitive:E. coli (150 mM NaCl), CaCl2-insensitive:E. coli (3 mM), MgCl2-insensitive:E. coli (2 mM), although its activity reduced in the presence of 5 mM or more CaCl2.Toxicity: 50% hemolytic concentration HC50 is 87.5 ug/mL (cf. 2.3 ug/mL for piscidin 1: AP473): moderate hemolytic.
