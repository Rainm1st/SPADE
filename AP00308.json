  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Derived from buforin I after treatment with endoproteinase Lys-C. It displayed a more potent antimicrobial activity than its parent molecule. Both are much more active than magainin 2.Activity:  Active against Gram+ bacteria B. subtilis (MIC 2 ug/ml), S. aureus (MIC 4 ug/ml), S. mutans (MIC 2 ug/ml), S. pneumoniae (MIC 4 ug/ml), P. putida (MIC 2 ug/ml), Gram- bacteria E. coli (MIC 4 ug/ml), S. typhimurium (MIC 1 ug/ml), Serratia sp. (MIC 4 ug/ml), fungi C. albicans (MIC 1 ug/ml), C. neoformans (MIC 1 ug/ml), and S. cerevisiae (MIC 1 ug/ml).  Both buforin II and its derivative buforin IIb (sequence: RAGLQFPVGRLLRRLLRRLLR) showed selective anticancer activity against 62 cancer cell lines (Lee 2008 Cancer Lett 271: 47-51). The sequence of histonin is RAGLQFPVGKLLKKLLKRLKR.Structure:  In TFE, buforin II contains a helix-hinge-helix structure with the first 4 aa disordered. A proline connects helix 1 (residues 5-10) and  helix 2 (residues 12-21).MOA:bacteria:  It kills bacteria without lysing the cell. Instead, this peptide translocates across bacterial membranes effectively.  This is a typical peptide example that does not target bacterial membranes but internal targets such as nucleic acids. It has a strong affinity for DNA and RNA in vitro (Park et al 1998. Biochem Biophys Res Commun 244: 253-7).Updated 12/2008; Jan2013; 10/2016; 5/2020; 7/2021; 6/2024",
