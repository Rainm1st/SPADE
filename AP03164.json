    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (40.9%) toEsculentin-2B. Six cysteines has an unusual disulfide connectivity of Cys1-Cys6, Cys2-Cys5, and Cys3-Cys4 and an amidated C-terminus. Variation in peptide oxidation (M) has been observed.  turgencin AMox1 is most active.Activity:  Turgencin AMox1 (72% Mox1, 28% Mox0) is active against C. glutamicum (MIC 0.4 uM), B. subtilis (MIC 0.4 uM), S. aureus (MIC 6.3 uM), E. coli (MIC 0.8 uM), P. aeruginosa, A2058 (MIC 1.6 uM). Highly toxic to the human melanoma cancer cell line A2058 (IC50 1.4 uM).Toxicity:  It is also highly toxic to non-malignant human fibroblast cell line MRC-5 (IC50 4.8 uM).Recombinant production:yeast:Pichia pastoris: a his-tagged form was expressed and purified via affinity chromatography (Dong et al., 2023).
