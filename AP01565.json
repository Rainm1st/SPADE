    "Literature": "Induced via the IMD pathway.  Glycosylation at Thr at the N-terminal Pro-rich domain. In all assays, activity appeared glycosylation independent.  The C-terminal and N-terminal domains are both required for full activity. NMR and CD analysis revealed a lack of any defined structure even in the lipid environment(Winans KA et al., 1999;Cudic M et al., 1999). The peptide appeared to increase the inner and outer membrane permeability. Updated 10/5/2013.",
