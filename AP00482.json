  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: 8 ug peptide was isolated from 6.8 mg crude venom.Activity: Im-1 is active against Gram- E. coli NBRC 3972 (MIC 0.4-0.8 uM), Gram+ S. aureus NBRC 13276 (MIC 13-25 uM), and B. subtilis NBRC 3009 (MIC 0.8-1.6 uM).Note that purified peptide did not show lethal effect on the insect even injected at 250 ug/g although paralysis is observed.Structure: random coil in water and helical in 50% TFE.In vitro toxicity:  insect Sf-9 cells: IC50 ~5 uM, likely toxic.Entry histoty: The original thionin mutant was replaced 2/2010; updated 11/2024.",
