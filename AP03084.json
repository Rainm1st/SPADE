  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 27.5% similarity toCarnolysin.Activity: Vatamin A deficiency increases the risk of skin infection. Why? Hooper and colleagues found that vitamin A can induce the expression of resistin-like molecule alpha, which has antimicrobial effect. Its expression can protect animals from infection.Host expression: Significantly, a homologous antimicrobial protein is also expressed in humans.See AP3085.",
