    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is 80% similar tosynthetic PL-18K: 40%, L=F: 13%.Activity: active against E. coli (MIC 4 uM) and S. aureus (MIC 32 uM) in MHB.Antimicrobial robustness: the peptide become more active under non-standard conditions such as 10% MHB or PBS. NaCl-sensitive:E. coli (100-200 mM, MIC>64 uM) in PBS, MgCl2-sensitive:E. coli (6 mM, MIC 32 uM) in MHB; NaCl-sensitive:S. aureus (100-200 mM, MIC>64 uM) in PBS, MgCl2-sensitized:S. aureus (6 mM, MIC 4 uM) in MHB.",
