    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 53.7% similarity toccBD.Mol formula, C318H503N80O86S8; gravy=0.767; Mol Wt 7091.499.Activity:  While thioredoxin was not antimicrobial, fusion Trx-Defb1 inhibited the growth of A. hydrophila ATCC 7966 (MIC 36 uM). The bacterial growth in Trx-Defb1-treated group was sharply inhibited by more than 90% compared with PB and Trx groups, indicative of a lack of activity of Trx portion. It inhibits LPS-induced TNF-alpha and NO (anti-inflammatory). Another study using recombinant peptide found active against Gram+ L. monocytogenes ATCC 221,633 (MIC 60 ug/ml), S. aureus ATCC 25,923 (MIC 80 ug/ml), Gram- E. coli ATCC 25,922 (MIC 30 ug/ml), and S. typhimurium ATCC 14,028 (MIC 50 ug/ml). It also inhibits biofilmB formation of E. coli (Dong et al., 2022).In vitro toxicity: murine RBC: only 1.26% hemo.lysis up to 600 ug/ml. Also not toxic to RAW 264.7 cells till 500 ug/ml (MTT assay).
