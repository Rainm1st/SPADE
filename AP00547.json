  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "This peptide showed no activity to commonly met Gram+ or - bacteria but is active against M. humenis, a cell wall-free bacteria. Biological activities of maximin S2, S3, and S5 have not been tested. Maximin S1 is inactive. Thus, these inactive peptides have not been collected into APD2.",
