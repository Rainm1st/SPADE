    "Literature": "Structure: The disulfide array is identical to that of beta-defensins from bovine neutrophils.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Activity: active against Gram+ and Gram- bacteria as well as fungi such as C. albicans.SAR: Tryptic digestion led to two fragments. The N-terminal fragment displays a more potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria, whereas the C-terminal fragment is more potent against Gram-negative bacteria. Updated 2/2014; 3/2023.",
