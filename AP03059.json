    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 95.2% similarity toJaponicin-2OM1, which contains one additional N in the Rana box.  molecular weight: 2282.962; molecular formula: C112H184N24O22S2; GRAVY: 1.4.Activity:  active against S. aureus NCTC 10788 or MRSA NCTC 12493 (MIC 4 uM), MRSA B038 V1S1 A (MIC 8 uM), E. coli NCTC 10418 (MIC 16 uM),  P.aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC >512 uM), and C. albicans NCYC 1467 (MIC 4 uM).  Also antibiofilms of S. aureus (MBIC/MBEC: 4/16 uM), MRSA (MBIC/MBEC: 8/32 uM), and E. coli (MBIC/MBEC: 32/128 uM). The antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa is reduced 8-fold in the presence of this bacterial supernatant.MOA:bacteria: It permeabilized pathogen membranes.Structure:  the peptide formed a helix in membrane-mimetic 50% TFE or after complex with SDS micelles.Toxicity:  Low hemo-lytic at and below 32 uM (<25%) and MODERATE hemolytic (HC50 32-64 uM). 50% LDH release from NC1-H23 cells at 64 uM (MTT LC50 32-64 uM).Animal model:wax moths(G. mellonella larvae, n=30): MRSA strain B038 V1S1 A-infected 25% left after 120 h, 60% survived when treated at 25-50 mg/kg (cf. 80% treated with 20 mg/kg vancomycin). Treatment at 0, 12, and 24 h at 50 mg/kg reduced the deaths of Galleria mellonella. In addition, the treated doses did not reduce survival of the insects (Yuan et al., 2019). Updated 7/2021; 9/2024",
