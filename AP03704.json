    "Literature": "Discovery: isolated chromatographically from pooled skin secretions.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (57.14%) toPictuseptin-3V=K: 16%; A=T: 12%; GRAVY: 0.774; M Wt: 2384.022; Mol formula: C108H195N27O28S2; molar extinction coeff: 0.Activity: active against Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 12600 (MIC 31.3 uM), Gram- E. coli ATCC 35218 (MIC 7.8 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC 49472 (MIC 15.6 uM), and P. aeruginosa ATCC 9072 (MIC 15.6 uM). Also showed cytotoxicity to cancer cells: lung adenocarcinoma A549 (LC50 23 uM), breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells (LC50 26.3 uM), and colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells (LC50 52.2 uM).Toxicity: This peptide is not selective due to similar LC50 to non-cancer cell human umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVEC (LC50 53.3 uM).Structure: random coil in water and became helical in the presence of 50% TFE, DPC or SDS micelles.",
