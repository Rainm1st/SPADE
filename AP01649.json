    "Literature": "Activity: fish pathogens S. iniae (MIC 2.46 uM), L. garvieae (MIC 0.61 uM), V. anguillarum (MIC 4.91 uM), A-salmonicida (MIC >78.61 uM), human pathogens E. faecalis (MIC 1.23 uM), S. aureus (MIC 2.46 uM), S. flexneri (MIC 2.46 uM), and E. coli (MIC 4.91 uM). Its minimum parasiticidal concentrations (PC100 2.48 uM). It is also active against channel catfish virus (CCV) as well as frog virus 3 (FV3) (Chinchar VG et al. Virol. 323:268-275). It differs from piscidin 1 only at position 18 (R in piscidin 1 and K in piscidin 2). Thus, its structure is predicted to be helical, i.e. very similar to piscidin 1 (APD entry 473).  also named moronecidin, moro-NH2 (see ref AP2785). Updated 9/2014; Jan2017.",
