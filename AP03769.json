    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (40%) toHalictine 2. L: 22%; M=N=K: 11%. Discovered from the human unconventional myosin 1h protein by computer prediction.Activity: weakly active against S.aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC 128 uM), S. epidermidis (MIC 64 uM), and C. albicans (MIC 64 uM).Toxicity: human RBC: HC50 >128 uM. not hemo.lytic.Structure: it became helical after binding to lipids. More helical in the presence of anionic DMPG (85.9%) than DMPC (40.3%).",
