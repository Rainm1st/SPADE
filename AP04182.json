    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (52.38%) toPolyphemusin IV: 15%; C: 20%; R: 25%. GRAVY: -0.215; Mol Wt: 2383.886; mol formula: C99H165N36O24S4; mol ex coeff: 7290.Chemical modification: two difulfide bonds: C5-C18 and C9-C14.Activity: active against Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 6538P (MIC 8 uM), M. luteus B-1314 (MIC 4 uM), B. subtilis B-886 (MIC 16 uM), Gram- E. coli ATTC 25922 or ML-35p or CI 214 or MDR CI 1057 or MDR CI 3600 (MIC 0.125-0.5 uM), E. cloacae XDR CI 4172 (MIC 4 uM), A. baumanii XDR CI 2675 or XDR CI 450 (MIC 0.25-0.5 uM),  K. pneumonia ATCC 700603 or MDR CI 358 or XDR CI 1056 or XDR CI 3395 (MIC 2-4 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 or PAO1 or MDR CI 223 or XDR CI 236 or XDR CI 1049 or XDR CI 1995 metallo-beta-lactamase producing strain (MIC 2-8 uM), and  S-marcescens MDR CI 1689 (MIC >32 uM). CI=clinical isolates; MDR, multidrug resistant strain. XDR, extensively drug resistant strain. It also prevented E. coli biofilm formation and destroy preformed mature biofilms:bacteria.Toxicity: not hemo.lytic (HC50>100 uM). much less toxic than tachyplesin-1.Structure:  a beta-hairpin structure with two S-S bonds was found. The two strands: residues 4-9 and 14-19.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. A subsequent study revealed monomer-dimer equilibrium in the micelle-cound state (Mironov et al., 2024). monomer:here; dimer:here.MOA:bacteria:E. coli: it appeared to act on membranes (permebilization).Resistance development:no:bacteria:E. coli: after 21 passages, E. coli did not develop resistance to this peptide (Safronova et al., 2022).",
