  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (66.67%) toverine. W: 50%; R: 50%. GRAVY: 2.7; M Wt: 1387.619; M formula: C68H94N24O9, mol ex coeff: 22200. This KR-8 derived peptide (Abraham et al., 2023) turned out to be the same as Octa 2 designed previously (see ref).Activity: Active against E. coli (MIC 5.4-8 uM), S. aureus (MIC 1.8-8 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 3.6-8 uM), K-pneumoniae (MIC>32 uM), and A-baumannii (MIC >32 uM) in MHB (previous MICs merged with LL-37mini. LL-37mini did not show anti-attachment activity, but inhibited biofilm formation at 1 uM (below MIC) and disrupted preformed biofilms:S. aureus USA300 (24-72 h).Toxicity: human RBC: HC50 >>200 uM, not hemo.lytic.MOA:bacteria: it permeabilized (but did not depolarize) membranes of S. aureus USA300 and caused damage to cells (SEM).Resistance development:no:bacteria:S. aureus: MRSA did not develop resistance to the peptide after 17 passages.Animal model:mouse: in a chronic wound model, this peptide was active against S. aureus USA300 (most data from Abraham et al. 2023).
