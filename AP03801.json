    "Literature": "Peptide design: obtained by replacing F27 of FK13-a4 with W.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (92.31%) toFK13-a5.  R: 31%; W: 31%; K: 15%. GRAVY: -1.92; M Wt: 1984.383; M formula:  C96H146N32O15, mol ex coeff:  22200.Activity: Active against E. coli KCTC 1682 (MIC 4 uM), P. aeruginosa KCTC 1637 (MIC 16 uM), S. typhimurium KCTC 1926 (MIC 2 uM), Gram+ B. subtilis KCTC 3068 (MIC 8 uM), S. epidermidis KCTC 1917 (MIC 4 uM), and  S. aureus KCTC1621 (MIC 2 uM). Non-standard assay: activity was measured in 1% peptone where LL-37 (control) is active against S. aureus.Toxicity: human RBC: HC50 167 uM, less hemo.lytic.Structure: helical in 50% TFE.Anti-inflammatory: suppressed NO 86%, and TNF-alpha 26.7% (cf. LL-37: 100% and 90.4%, respectively).",
