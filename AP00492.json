Hence, chemical modification may be unimportant or does not occur (unless a modified aa is used).Activity: Active against Gram+ B. subtilis (MIC 8 ug/ml), S. aureus (MIC 8 ug/ml), S. mutans (MIC 16 ug/ml), S. pneumoniae (MIC 8 ug/ml), P. putida (MIC 8 ug/ml), Gram- E. coli (MIC 8 ug/ml), S. typhimurium (MIC 8 ug/ml), Serratia sp. (MIC 16 ug/ml), Fungi C. albicans (MIC 16 ug/ml), C. neoformans (MIC 8 ug/ml), and S. cerevisiae (MIC 4 ug/ml). more active than magainin 2 (MIC 12-100 ug/ml).Toxicity: sheep RBC: not hemo.lytic (0.4%) at 100 uM.Structure: it has no structure in PBS and became helical in 50% TFE.Updated 12/2012; Jan2013; 7/2021; 11/2023.",
