    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (81.82%) toL5K5WL: 45%; K: 36%; C: 18%.Chemical modification:  one three-way simultaneous bond via the benzene platform to two Cys residues and sidechain of K11. In addition,Activity: active against P. aeruginosa PAO1 (MIC 8 ug/ml), A. baumannii ATCC19606 (MIC 4 ug/ml), K. pneumoniae NCTC418 (MIC 16 ug/ml), and S. aureus COL MRSA (MIC 8 ug/ml).In vitro toxicity: incubation 4 h; minimalum hemolytic concentration (MHC): 16.5 ug/ml, hemolytic.SAR: lineralized peptide (AP4944) is more active and less hemolytic.",
