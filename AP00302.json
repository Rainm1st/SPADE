    "Literature": "host expression:induced:In white bass liver, hepcidin gene expression was induced 4500-fold following challenge with the fish pathogen, Streptococcus iniae, while expression levels remained low in all other tissues tested.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is unique and shows only very low similarity (79.17%) toSA-hepcidin2; C: 38%.Activity: active against Gram+ E-faecalis (VRE) (MIC >44 uM), S-aureus (MRSA) (MIC >44 uM), S-iniae KST (MIC >44 uM), Gram- A-hydrophilia, A-salmonicida, E-cloacae, E-tarda, K-oxytoca, P-aeruginosa, S-arizonae, S- choleraesuis, S-typhimurium,  S-marcescens (MIC >44 uM), E. coli 3 strains (MIC 11-22 uM), K. pneumoniae (MIC 22 uM), P. shigelloides (MIC 11 uM), S. flexneri (MIC 22 uM), S. sonnei (MIC 44 uM), Y. enterocolitica (MIC 22 uM), filamentous fungi A. niger (MIC 44 uM) and yeast C-albicans (MIC > 44 uM).Structure: For solution structure, refer to Lauth X et al (2005) J Biol Chem 280: 9297-9282 (PDB ID: 1S6W).  Beta strand 1: residues 3-5; beta-strand 2: residues 16-18.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.In vitro toxicity: Freshly packed striped bass erythrocytes, fish RBC: Hepcidin was non-hemolytic up to 44 uM.Synergy:AMPs: Good synergistic bacterial killing observed between hepcidin and moronecidin (FIC ~0.5).Updated 7/2021; Jan2025",
