    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (34.78%) toLividin 8 HLmbV=G=P=Y=Q=K: 11%. GRAVY: -1.0; mol Wt: 2187.437; mol formula: C101H149N26O28; mol ex coeff: 8530. This is a unique sequence differing from all other amphibian peptides in the APD.Activity: active against E.coli ATCC25922 (MIC >100 ug/ml), B. dysenteriae (MIC 60 ug/ml), S. aureus ATCC2592 (MIC 15 ug/ml), and C. albicans ATCC2002 (MIC 30 ug/ml).In vitro toxicity: rabbit RBC: little hemolysis up to 100 ug/ml.",
