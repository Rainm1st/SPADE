  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "The sequence is nearly identical to esculentin-1 identified in the European R. esculenta. The exceptions are (1) residues 7-8 are AG and (2) residue 22 is I. The peptide showed broad activity against G+ and G- bacteria but poor hemolytic activity. active against M. luteus (MIC 6.3 ug/ml), B. subtilis (MIC 6.3 ug/ml), G- S. dysentariae (MIC 12.5 ug/ml), E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. typhimurium (MIC 25 ug/ml),  K. pneumoniae (12.5 ug/ml).  CD studies revealed helical conformation in TFE, SDS, or DPC.  Solution structure was thus determined in 70% TFE (Mol Cell 2010; 30:435-41), since the spectral resolution was insufficient in SDS or DPC. The three helical regions are residues K5-S17, G23-R32, and A38-K43. Update 10/29/2012; 5/2020.",
