    "Literature": "Chemical modification:  It resembles lassos since the carboxylic side chain of Asp8 forms a bond with the N-terminal Gly.Activity: Active against both growing and dormant mycobacteria, including drug-resistant M. tuberculosis (anti-TB).MOA:bacteria:lassomycin binds to a highly acidic region of the ClpC1 ATPase complex. ClpC1 ATPase is an essential enzyme in mycobacteria. This mechanism, uncoupling ATPase from proteolytic activity, accounts for the bactericidal activity of lassomycin.Structure: NMR structure of the cyclic peptide has been solved. in addition, high-resolution crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of ClpC1 (ClpC1 NTD) in complex with Lassomycin provides insight into the binding mode (Jagdev et al., 2023).
