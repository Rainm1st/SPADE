    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of CbnX shows 40% similarity toPlasticin PD36K.  The sequence of CbnY is SAILAITLGIFATGYGMGVQKAINDRRKK with a basic C-terminus.Activity: Active against two indicator strains C. divergens LV13 (MIC 4 uM) and C. maltaromaticum A9b- (MIC 8 uM) using spot-on-lawn assays. MIC values are 15.6 and 31.25 uM based on the microdilution method. The MIC was defined as the total CnbXY that inhibited growth by 50%. The two chains need be combined to generate antimicrobial activity.Structure: CbnX and CbnY contain the characteristic GXXXG motifs. CbnX is disordered in water and became helical in the presence of TFE (78% helix). CbnY contains some helical feature in water (~39%) and became more helical in TFE (81%) based on CD studies. NMR: CbnX is helical from residues 2-26 with a flexible C-terminnus. CbnY, in the L shape, contains two helical regions residues 2-15 and 17-27 connected by a loop.",
