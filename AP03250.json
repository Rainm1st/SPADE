    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (92%) toHp1090. The peptide sequence from Octopus minor corresponds to N-terminal FF truncated form of chrysophsin-2 from Chrysophrys major.Activity: Weakly active against C. albicans (MIC 50 ug/mL), which was essentially all killed at 100 ug/ml (MFC). Also showed significant activity against carbapenem-resistant E. coli (MIC 4-8 ug/ml) MBC higher (see the 2023 Kong ref).Toxicity: weak toxicity to RAW 264.7 cell line till 128 ug/ml (toxic at 256 ug/ml); likewise, little hemo.lytic at 128 ug/ml (increased toxicity at 256 ug/ml or greater).MOA:fungi: It appears to act on membranes and may also induce ROS. 95% HEK293T cells survived at 100 ug/ml.Animal model:zebrafish: showed in vivo efficacy; Animal model:wax moth: it also protected G. mellonella from infection-caused death (Kong et al., 2023.Updated 9/2023",
