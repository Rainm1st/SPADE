Active against S. aureus and Y. enterocolitica (80% inhibition at 15 ug/ml).  It is a endogenous peptide with higher levels in preterm milk. Another form corresponding to residues 211-225 has also been found (Wang et al., 2020).Activity: This form is active against E. coli (MIC 3.125 ug/ml) and Y. enterocolitica (MIC 6.25 ug/ml).
