    "Literature": "Host expression: highly expressed in the fat body, followed by the hemolymph, midgut, muscle, and defensive glands.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (69.57%) toDiapausin-1C: 15%; R=S: 10%. GRAVY: -0.898; M Wt: 4457.971; Mol formula:  C176H277N61O60S7; molar extinction coeff: 3355.Activity: active against C. albicans ATCC 10231 and clinical strains (MIC 5.4-7 uM) and T. rubrum (MIC 5.3 uM), but inactive against E.coli ATCC 8739 and S.aureus ATCC 6538. It also inhibited biofilm formation and disrupted preformed biofilms of C. albicans.Antimicrobial robustness: activity is retained at pH 3-5 but reduced at basic pH. Thermostable till 90oC. Activity reduces with the incubation time in human serum for 24 h.Toxicity: little hemo.lytic till 56.25 uM but almost 50% lysis at 112.5 uM (HC50 >100 uM). No cytotoxicity to mouse RAW 264.7 cells (10 power6 cells/ml) till 225 uM. Es. 5/2023",
