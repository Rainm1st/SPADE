  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "This sequence is 77.78% similar to AP01158 (RP-1 from platelet factor-4). L:33%; K:39%.Activity: Active against Gram- E. coli (ref). Active against E. coli (MIC 1.875 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 7.5 uM), A. baumannii (MIC 1.875 uM), S. aureus (MIC 1.875 uM), and B. subtilis (MIC 1.875 uM) (Kohn et al., 2018). It also showed selective anticancer activity (Peck-Miller et al., 1993).Structure: random coils in PBS buffer, helical in 50% TFE, SDS (more helical than in TFE) and PC/PG vesicles (most helical).MOA: membrane permeabilization of E. coli and S. aureus.SAR: more helical in lipids than Arg, His, onithine, and XX analogs. C18G is more membrane permeable than analogs, Lys> Arg>Orn>His>Dap.Toxicity: RBC: less than 1% hemolysis at 100 ug/ml. Another study found 9% hemolysis of sheep RBC at 15 uM peptide.Animal model:mouse: neutropenic mice, systemic infection IP, treatment 1 and 3.5 h post-infection I.M., signficant protection was observed (~50% for C18G at 3 mg/kg and 75% for the C18G D-form, C18X at 0.5 mg/kg) only when the peptide was combined with antibiotic. Dose-dependent efficacy was observed for the combination as well for 10 days.",
