  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: The same peptide sequence was also reproted byGiovannini MG et al in 1987as PGS without antibacterial data.Activity: Active against E. coli D31 (MIC 5 ug/ml), K. pneumoniae, P. putida, S. epidermidis (MIC 10 ug/ml), C. freundii (MIC 30 ug/ml), E. cloacae, E. coli, S. aureus (MIC 50 ug/ml), C. albicans (MIC 80 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa, and S. marcescens (MIC 100 ug/ml). Also S. pyogenes, and S. cerevisiae. Also active against P. falciparum, protozoan P. caudatum (minimal disruptive conc MDC 10 ug/ml), A. castellani (MDC 2 ug/ml), and T. pyriformis (MDC 20 ug/ml).  More active against a mprF mutant strain (Peschel  et al., 2001). Also active against B. dendrobatidis (Table 1, Rollins-Smith, BBA 2009; 1788:1593-1599).Synergy:AMPs:  Magainin II shows a synergistic effect with cecropin A (J Antimicrob Chemother. 2008; 62:1332-8).MOA:bacteria:  it kills bacteria by targeting membranes and forming a pore (forms D=L).   It also inhibits Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 (PubMed2004). Magainin II only showed a weak activity against channel catfish virus (ref) as well as P388 leukemia, S180 ascites, and a spontaneous ovarian tumor (Baker et al., 1993).   It is also insecticidal (EC50 123 pmol/mg fly).Toxicity: little hemo.lytic (6%) till 1000 ug/ml (cf. mellitin showed 100% lysis at 50 ug/ml).Structure: Alpha helix: residues 4-21 in TFE, SDS, DPC (for the ref., go to PDB website below).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Derivative: MSI-594 (provided by Ed Ezell) (sequence GIGKFLKKAKKGIGAVLKVLTTGL-NH2) is engineered based on magainin and melittin. Derivative 3: NSI-99: transgenic plants: expression of a magainin analog (MSI-99, sequence GIGKFLKSAKKFGKAFVKIKNS-NH2, 22mer, more basic) in tomato and banana reduced bacterial speck disease (Planta. 2003 Feb;216(4):587-96).Surface immobilized peptide: Magainin has also been covalently immobilized 1995S L Haynie et al.to a water insoluble resin.Peptide engineering: multiple stapled peptides have been made based on magainin to improve its stability (Mourtada et al., 2019).Nucleic acid delivery: Magainin 2-derived stapled peptides conferred with the ability to deliver pDNA, mRNA, and siRNA into cells (Hirano et al.2023Animal model:mouse: stapled magainin showed in vivo efficacy (see Mourtada 2019 ref above). updated 4/2017; 9/2017; 8/2019; 7/2021; 10/2023",
