    "Literature": "Activity: Active against F. oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum (IC50 1 uM), L. maculans (IC50 0.8 uM), A. nidulans (IC50 0.8 uM), V. dahliae (IC50 0.75 uM),  T. bisicola (IC50 0.8 uM), B. cinerea, A. niger, Cryptococcus species, activity against the yeasts S-cerevisiae, C-albicans (IC50>10 uM), P-pastoris, S-aureus, B-cereus, E-coli, P-aeruginosa (IC50 all >10 uM) (van der Weerden et al., 2008).Antimicrobial robustness: MgCl2-sensitive:C. albicans (5 mM); CaCl2-sensitive:C. albicans (2 mM);Structure: NaD1 itself forms a dimer  in the crystal (Lay et al., 2012).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.  In 2014, the crystal structure of a NaD1:PIP2 or PI(4,5)P2 complex was also solved. Remarkably, seven dimers of NaD1 (14 momecules) oligomerize into an arch configuration to cooperatively bind the anionic headgroups of 14 phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) molecules  (Poon IKh et al., 2014).MOA:fungi: Like RsAFP2, NaD1 is unable to disrupt lipid vesicles. The antifungal activity involves specific interaction with the fungal cell wall (surface protein) followed by membrane permeation and entry of the cell to affect internal targets (van der Weerden et al. 2008 J Biol Chem 283:14445-14452; van der Weerden et al 2010 JBC 285:37513-37520). It is proposed that the peptide enters fungal cytoplasm via he energy-dependent process of endocytosis (Hayes et al., 2018). Evidence for carpet model (Järvå M et al., 2018). NaD1 induces tumor cell death via a non-apoptotic, membranolytic process (Baxter AA et al., 2017).Synergy:AMPs: NaD1 shows a synergistic antifungal effect withBovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitoragainst plant pathogens F. graminearum and C. graminicola and the animal pathogen C. albicans (Bleackley MR et al., 2017). Also, Synergy:drug, synergy with caspofungin (antifungal drug), hBD2, and LL-37 against C. albicans (Shevchenko et al., 2024).Updated 12/30/10; 5/30/2013; 4/2014; 2/2018; 8/2018; 7/2021",
