    "Literature": "Activity: Activity against E. coli CIP 76.24, P. aeruginosa CIP 76.110 (MIC 1ug/ml), Y. enterocolitica CIP 80.27, S. aureus ATCC 29213 and S. epidermidis CIP 68.21 (MIC 0.5ug/ml). Human HNP-3 blocks papillomavirus infection (both cutaneous and mucosal papillomavirus types) HNPs 1-3 and HD-5 have been reported to be present in the female genital tract at levels that overlap those that inhibit HPVs in vitro (Buck et al., 2006). HNP-3 is active against pseudotyped viruses expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins (Xu et al., 2021). anti-toxin: HNP3 can partially protect human neutrophils against Panton-Valentine leukocidin of S. aureus by reducing PVL pore formation (Cardot-Martin E et al. 2015).Structure: The dimeric structure of HNP-3 in the crystal is the first atomic structure for defensins solved by X-ray diffraction (Hill et al., 1991). Compared to HNP-2, HNP-3 contains one additional residue (Asp) at the N-terminus. S-S bond pattern: Cys1–Cys6, Cys2–Cys4, and Cys3–Cys5. The 3D structures remain the same.You can rotate, zoom, and view the dimeric crystal structureherein the PDB. Enzyme inhibitor: it inhibits protein kinase C (Charp et al., 1988).Updated 10/2015; 8/2021; Jan2023",
