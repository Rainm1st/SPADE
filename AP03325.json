    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (33.33%) toAcidocin BGRAVY: 0.918; Mol formula:  C264H425N65O79S1; M. Wt: 5818.745, and Mol ex coeff.: 0.Activity:  Active against Gram-positive B. subtilis, S. epidermidis, S. aureus and Gram-negative E. coli (MIC 25-48 uM), P. aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, S. flexneri, A. hydrophila (MICs 12-24 uM), and yeast C. neoformans and P. pastoris GS115 (MICs 24-48 uM).Toxicity:  not toxic to crab hemocytes and HEK-293T cells till 24 uM.Animal model:crabs: incubation of the peptide with V. alginolyticus followed by injection into crabs shows innmunoprotective effect although it did not inhibit the bacterium in vitro. This may be related to its potent binding affinity with several polysaccharides.",
