    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (50%) todatabase designed peptide GLK-19.Activity: Active against E. coli CRE (MIC 1-8 uM), E. coli ESBL (MIC 1-4 uM), A. baumannii CRE (MIC 1-8 uM), K. pneumoniae CRE (MIC 2-128 uM),  K. pneumoniae ESBL (MIC 4, 3  K.pneumoniae strains MIC >128 uM), P. aeruginosa CRE (MIC 8-16 uM, 1 strain MIC >128 uM), E. faecalis (MIC 8-16, and 3 E.faecalis strains MIC >128 uM), and S. aureus MRSA (MIC 2, 64, 3 S.aureus strains MIC >128 uM). The bad news is that there are already clinical strains that are resistant to this newly designed cationic peptide with MIC > 128 uM.  7/2021",
