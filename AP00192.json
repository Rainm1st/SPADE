Hepcidin is the master regulator of extracellular iron availability in vertebrates, but its role in the context of host defense is undefined.Michels KR et al (2017)found that hepcidin actually plays an important role in protecting against bacterial dissemination during pneumoniae by sequesting the iron. It also shows anti-cancer activity against h\\Human and mouse myeloma Cells (David M Conrad et al, 2021).Ref updated 7/2013; 2/2014; 12/2016; 3/2017; 4/2019; 7/2021.",
