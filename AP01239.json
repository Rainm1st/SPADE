    "Literature": "The predicted mature sequence has 34-aa. The isolated peptide with N-terminal 4-aa truncation might be a further processed product.  Since 2016, cathelicidin-BF is also called cathelicidin-WA (reason unknown). Importantly, it showed low toxicity against human blood cells.  NMR structure in TFE  was not presented due to incomplete restraints. Segments KF1-11, KF12-19, and KF20-30 had no activity. Active against E. coli ATCC25922 (MIC 2.3 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC278953 (MIC 1.2 uM), S. aureus ATCC2592, and C. albicans (MIC 4.7 uM). Salt-insensitive: The activities did not change much in the presence of 150 mM NaCl. The peptide and its lysine 16 variant also possesses anticancer effects(Tian Y et al. 2013). A derivative called BF-15 was designed. BF-15 is composed of the N-terminal 10 amino acid residues (162KFFRKLKKSV172 of the precursor) of the peptide and another successive linked 5 amino acid residues (157VKRFK161 of the precursor) from the precursor amino acid sequence of BF-30. This peptide also inhibits E. coli ATP synthase (Azim et al., 2016). Cbf-K(16), Cbf-A(7), and Cbf-A(13) were obtained by mutating Lys(16), Ala(7), and Ala(13) of BF-30, respectively. Active against E. coli BL21 (DE3)-NDM-1 (Hao Q et al., 2013). The BF-30 K16 mutant also inhibits non-small cell lung cancer (Tian et al., 2013). Animal model:mouse. i.v. injection did not show CFU reductiomn. However, pretreatment with cathelicidin-BF ameliorates P. aeruginosa pneumonia in mice by enhancing NETosis and the autophagy of recruited neutrophils and macrophages (Liu C et al., 2018).
