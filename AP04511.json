    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (90%) toEntV 10merV=L=A=Q: 20%, others: 10%.Activity: active against C. albicans and C. gattii based on the survival of the infected animal model:Caenorhabditis elegans.  P4 appeared to be better than other Px peptides in the series in protecting the animals from C. gattii infection.Animal model:mouse: Like its parent peptide EntV, P1 protected mice from C. albicans systemic infection.",
