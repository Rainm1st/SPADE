GRAVY: 0.22; Mol Wt:  7520.186; mol formula:  C333H550N100O81S8; mol ex coeff:  3355.Activity: active against bacteria E. coli NTHI 86-028NP, S. pneumoniae type 14, and M. catarrhalis 1857, and the fungus C. albicans. All essentially killed at 20 ug/ml. Non-standard assay: killing effect: incubated 1 h followed by plating to detect survival bacteria.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: his-tagged recombinant peptide was expressed and purified via affinity chromatography and used for activity test.",
