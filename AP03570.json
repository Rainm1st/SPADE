    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (62.07%) toSMAP-29R=G=22%; K:17%; L:11%; Mol. Wt: 3287.864; GRAVY: -0.98; Mol Formula:  C91H161N35O20; mol ex coeff: 1490.Activity: Active against Gram+ B. subtilis (MIC 8 uM),  S. epidermidis (MIC 4 uM), S. aureus (MIC 8 uM), Gram- E. coli (MIC 4 uM),  S. typhimurium (MIC 8 uM), and P. aeruginosa (MIC 8 uM) (June et al., 2023).SAR: G2A and G13A showed similar activity, while G7A became 1-4 fold weaker. Interestingly, G7,13A was more active against Gram+ B. subtilis and S. aureus. G2,7,13A became more active against both selected Gram+ (B. subtilis) and Gram- bacteria (P. aeruginosa) (June et al., 2023).Structure: CD: random coil in water and helical in 50% TFE. NMR: residues 6-10 are helical (short).Toxicity: SMAP-18 displayed no cytotoxicity at 100 uM to three different mammalian cells RAW 264.7, NIH-3T3 and HeLa cells.MOA: unlike SMAP-29 or SMAP-18-W, SMAP-18 did not cause any membrane depolarization even at 4 Ã— MIC. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed translocation of SMAP-18 across the membrane in a non-membrane disruptive manner by targeting intracellular nucleic acids.Peptide engineering: L-to-D-amino acid substitution of SMAP-18 improved antimicrobial activity by 2-8 fold (D>L), probably due to the stability against proteases inside bacterial cells (Jacob et al., 2016).
