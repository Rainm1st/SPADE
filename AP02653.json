    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide most resembles (88.5% similarity)P. sarana Hepcidin.  Mol. Wt: 3009.624. GRAVY=-0.24.  Active against S. aureus (MIC 50 uM), Gram- V. fluvialis (MIC 25 uM), V. anguillarum (MIC 50 uM), V. alginolyticus (MIC 50 uM), V-parahaemloyticus (MIC >50 uM), and E. coli. The antibacterial activity of SA-hepcidin1 is stronger than that of SA-hepcidin2. Updated 7/2021",
