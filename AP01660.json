  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "This peptide was first reported in 1999 (Khoo L, Robinette DW, Noga EJ. 1999 Mar Biotechnol (NY). Jan;1(1):44-51). However, a complete sequence is only published in the new ref cited herein. Antibacterial activity was described in the 1999 paper (antibacterial in general?). The first Trp residue can be modified into three isoforms (hydroxy-N-formylkynurenine (major), N-formylkynurenine, and hydroxy-Trp (minor)). The pattern of the disulfide bonds has not been defined yet. The S-S bonds, as well as other possible chemical modifications, could be important for peptide stability.",
