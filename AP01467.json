    "Literature": "Activity: Active against B. subtilis (MIC 0.7 uM), S. aureus (MIC 3.9 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 18.7 uM), and E. coli (MIC 1.4 uM). Also killed C. albicans and inhibited its conversion from the single cell yeast form to hyphal form (Vrablikova et al., 2017). The D-form appeared to be equally active (D=L).Toxicity: Low hemo.lytic toxicity (HC50 >220 uM).Structure: NMR studies in TFE.Animal model:mouse: in DBA/2 murine models of vulvovaginal candidiasis, intravaginal administratioat at daily doses of 0.7 and 1.4 ug LLIII per mouse led to Candida CFU drop to 34% and 38%, respectively, one week after infection compared to the untreated control group. No adverse effects were observed.Peptide engineering: to increase peptide stability, 1-2 staples were introduced via ring-closing olefin metathesis. The stapled peptides substantially increased hemolysis and reduced antimicrobial activity. Two staples are better than one to increase peptide helicity and resistance to protease (Chapuis et al., 2012).Surface immobilized peptide: LL-III has also been covalently immobilized via a cysteine added to the N-terminus onto a commercial silicone catheter surface. The surface-coated catheter is antbacterial against E. coli and E. faecalis (Mishra et al., 2014).MOA: Both the free (Battista et al., 2021) and immobilized forms (Mishra et al., 2014) acted on membranes. Anionic lipids are preferred. Updated 7/2021; Jan2023",
