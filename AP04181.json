  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (81.82%) toBP76K: 55%; L: 27%.Chemical modification:  tosylated form.Activity: active against plant pathogenic bacterial strains P. syringae pv. syringae (MIC 2.5-5.0 uM), X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria (MIC 2.5-5.0 uM), and E-amylovora (MIC >7.5 uM).Toxicity: human RBC: HC50 >150 uM, not hemo.lytic.SAR: the peptide became slightly more active against Ea when benzylation (BP126), rather than tosylation, was made.Plant protection:apple: Plant protection:pear: flowers pretreated at 100 and 200 uM of BP125 or BP126 reduced the infection of plant pathogen E. amylovora.",
