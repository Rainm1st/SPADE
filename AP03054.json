  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 38% similarity toCathelicidin-AL. To test for antimicrobial activity of NUR, they used the Alamar Blue cell viability assay and examined survival of bacteria treated with NUR.Activity:Active against Gram- bacteria S. marcescens or E. coli (no inhibition concentration).AMP significance and sleep: The expression of this peptide in brain influences fly sleep and survival. Flies overexpressing this peptide enable better survial against S. marcescens and S. pneumoniae infection. Updated 7/2021",
