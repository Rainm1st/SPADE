    "Literature": "Activity: Active against bacteria C. michiganensis (EC50 1 uM), R. solanacearum  (EC50 2 uM). fungi F. culmorum (EC50 0.2 uM), F. solani (EC50 11 uM), C. lagenarium (EC50 11 uM), B. maydis (EC50 11 uM), S-nodorum (EC50 >20 uM), and T-viridae (EC50 >20 uM).Antimicrobial robustness: salt-sensitive: activity is abolished in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2 + 50 mM KCl.Recombinant production:bacteria: the Escherichia coil expression has been established (Gbala et al., 2022). This form of peptide is active against E. coli (MIC 30 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa (MIC 7.5 ug/ml), K. pneumoniae (MIC 30 ug/ml), and C. albicans (MIC 7.5 ug/ml). However, MBC values are much higher.
