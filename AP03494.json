GRAVY: -0.15; Mol Wt: 2693.147; Mol formula:  C122H201N36O31; mol ex Coeff:  7040.Activity: Active against E-faecium (MIC >64 uM), S. aureus (MIC 0.5 uM), K. pneumoniae (MIC 0.5 uM), A. baumannii (MIC 0.25 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 1 uM), E. cloacae (MIC 0.5 uM), E. coli (MIC 1 uM), S. Typhimurium (MIC 1 uM), and P. vulgaris (MIC 4 uM). Also inhibit biofilm formation.Organoid skin model: it eradicated S. aureus biofilms after 24 h treated at 200 ug. Animal model:mouse: it also showed an effect on skin infection.Structure: helical in SDS or DPC micelles.MOA: It depolarizes and permeabilizes membranes, which may lead to DNA binding (DNA retardation assay).
