  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Warning: the reported sequence is incomplete and 47% similar toShepherin I. Characterization of this peptide through MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry shows its molecular mass as 9.052 kDa. This peptide form shows poor homology with previously reported gloverin of 13.8 kDa.Activity: The isolated gloverin-like peptide specifically inhibits the growth of Gram-negative bacteria E. coli and E. cloacae (MIC 64 ug/ml) by destroying the cell wall / cell membrane, causing leackage. This activity is similar to the gloverin from Hylophora pupas but differs from the Manduca sexta gloverin, which is active against Gram+ bacteria.",
