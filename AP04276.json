  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (71.43%) to(WR)3-NH2W=R: 50%.Activity: Active against S. aureus SG511 or Mu50 VISA or COL or ATCC43300 MRSA (MIC 8-96 ug/ml), E. coli DSM30083 or W3110 (MIC 32 ug/ml) or >64 ug/ml,  A. baumannii (MIC 32 ug/ml), P-aeruginosa (MIC >64 ug/ml) (Wenzel et al., 2016).MOA:bacteria:E. coli: act on membranes. proteomic study revealed 134 proteins were differentially expressed, leading to the upregulation of the envelope stress induced protein and down-regulation of the mechano-sensitive channel MscL and so on (Fr√§nzel  et al., 2012). Also cause selective ion release from B. subtitlis (Wenzel et al., 2015).Resistance development:no:bacteria:B. subtilis: when treated at 4xMIC, no resitant colonies of B. subtilis were observed after 24 and 48 h (spontaneous resistance).Toxicity: caused shrinkage of murine RBC at 250 ug/ml (14% lysis) and cell damage at 500 ug/ml (23% lysis): low hemo.lysis detected. Not significantly cytotoxic against human liver carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, and breast cancer cell lines.Antimicrobial robustness: serum-sensitive: 50% activity is lost in the presence of undiluted bovin serum.Peptide conjugate:carbohydrate-binding module/protein (CBM): The CBM3-MP196-modified materials displayed antibacterial activity against E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus significantly higher than that of materials prepared by physical adsorption of MP196.",
