    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 40% similarity toPeptide 3967. GRAVY=0.6; Mol Mass. 1650.04.Activity: Broth microdilution: Active against S. aureus, Gram- S. putrefaciens (MIC 62.5 ug/ml), and E. coli.Peptide stability: cleaved by proteases trypsin, pepsin and proteinase K; retained activity pH 4-12, but reduced slightly at pH 2-3; stable at 40, 60, and 80oC, but activity started to reduce at 100oC.Toxicity: sheep RBC: poorly hemo.lytic at 500 ug/ml.Structure: Helical in 2.5% SDS. A proline is located in the middle of the sequence. This is similar to cell penetrating peptide buforin.MOA:bacteria: peptide treatment of S. putrefaciens led to total nucleotide leakage, suggesting pore formation. SEM showed a change in bacterial morphology. The peptide also binds to bacterial genomic DNA at 5 uM or greater. All in the well at high peptide concentrations.Updated 7/2021",
