    "Literature": "Activity: Active against fungi A. longipes (50% inhibition IC50 12 ug/ml), B. cinerea (IC50 25 ug/m), C. sphaerospermum, F. culmorum (IC50 6 ug/m), P. digitatum (IC50 6 ug/m), T. viride (IC50 12 ug/m), and V. alboatrum (IC50 12 ug/m).Antimicrobial robustness: Salt-sensitive: 50% inhibition concentration increased dramatically to >200 ug/ml when the medium was supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2 and 50 mM KCl.Chemical modification: The N-terminal glutamine is cyclized (pyroglutamate). It contains two S-S bonds (6-16 & 7-20). Updated 7/2021",
