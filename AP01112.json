    "Literature": "Also, active against E.coli (MIC >160 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 20 uM), S.aureus (MIC >160 uM), C.albicans (MIC >160 uM) (Strömstedt et al., 2017). It is found that a phospholipid-specific mechanism of membrane permeabilization, through interaction with phosphatidylethanolamine-lipids, is essential for cyclotides active primarily on Gram-negative bacteria (Strömstedt et al., 2017).
