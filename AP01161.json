    "Literature": "AMP Significance: The first AMP (mRNA: 519) identified in human CD8+ cytolytic T cells (Pena et al., 1997). Thus, the adaptive immune system has included AMPs for effective immunity.Activity: (see the ref), a recombinant peptide showed activity in vitro against bacteria (S. typhimurium, L. monocytogenes, E. coli, and S. aureus), fungi C. neoformans, C. albicans, and parasites L. major.Synergy:AMPs:  In particular, the peptide killed M. tuberculosis (anti-TB) extracellularly, and also intracellularly in the presence of pore-forming molecules such as perforin (synergy; see the ref).Structure:You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.MOA: Granulysin is cytolytic against tumor cells as well by inducing apoptosis of Jurkat, a human model tumor (Pena SV and Krensky AM 1997 Semin Immunol 9: 117-25; Gamen et al 1998 J Immunol 161: 1758-64).Chemotactic: It is a chemoattractant for various cells such as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and monocytes at 10 nM (Deng et al 2005 J Immunol 174:5243-8).Peptide engineering:  The therapeutic potential was explored by peptide design and helix 3-based peptides are active (da Silva et al. 2008 J Antimrob Chemother 61: 1103-9). The L- and D-forms of a peptide corresponding to residues 32-42 showed similar activity in vitro (D=L) (Hamamoto K et al 2002 Microbiol Immunol 46, 741=9). However, the D-form is stable to proteases. G13 contains part of the sequence (QRSVSNAATRVCRTGRSRW), the recombinant form of which displayed activity against B. subtilis and E. coli (Che Y et al., 2015).Amino acid sequence verified by Cyril Roblet 8/28/09.
