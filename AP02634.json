  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of peptide shows poor similarity to (29.5% similarity)human CCL20. CsCCK1 expression is increased by bacterial infection (with maximum inductions occurring at 4 h postinfection) and that purified recombinant CsCCK1 is a biologically active chemoattractant that can enhance cellular defense against bacterial infection. A clear reduction in intracellular pathogen E. tarda from 2012 CFU untreated to 372 CFU was observed after chemokine treatment.In addition, the conserved DCCL motif is functionally essential for chemokine. Thus, this antimicrobial chemokine plays a dual role in pathogen-induced immune response.",
