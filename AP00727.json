    "Literature": "Activity: active against L. monocytogenes EGD (MIC 0.6 ug/ml), Gram-negative E. coli ML-35p (MIC 4 ug/ml) and fungi C. albicans 820 (MIC 4.5 ug/ml). Also active against M. abscessus (MIC90 19 uM).Antimicrobial robustness: activity against E. coli was not influenced by 100 mM NaCl (NaCl-sensitive:E. coli), but activity against C. albicans was (NaCl-insensitive:C. albicans).Structure: Structure is reported by Lee JU et al 2007 Biopolymers 88: 208-216. It consists of an amphipathic 2-stranded beta-sheet which is important for biological activity. The peptide tends to form oligomers in membranes. Andra J et al. (2009) Biol Chem 390: 337-49 reported that the disulfide bond is critical to confer structural stability required for salt tolerance, protease action, as well as pore formation in the membranes.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.SAR: head-to-tail cyclization of AR-1 (ARcyclic) did not affect peptide activity clearly (Orlov et al., 2019). Replacement of C3 and C20 with alpha-amino-n-butyric \nacid (Abu) disrupted activity against M. abscessus.Resistance development:no:bacteria:M. abscessus: M. abscessus did not develop resistance to Ar-1 after 42 cycles of passage while the MIC of antibiotic clarithromycin increased 32 fold (Casanova et al., 2024).Updated 2/2014;11/2018; 7/2021; 6/2024.",
