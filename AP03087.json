  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 87.9% similarity toDybowskin-3. Likely helical.Activity:  Active against S. aureus (MIC 16 mg/L), E. coli (MIC 32 mg/L), and yeast C. albicans (MIC 64 mg/L).Toxicity: 20% hemolysis at 16 mg/L, 40% at 64 mg/L, 60% hemolysis at 128 mg/L, ~90% hemolysis at 256 mg/l.Anticancer: It also has antiproliferative effects on human cancer cells (H460, MB435, U251MG and HCT116) with IC50 3.47, 18.99, 2.32 and 2.02 uM, respectively. Since there is LDH release after peptide treatment, the anticancer effect of LFB on HCT116 is likely due to cell membrane disruption rather than apoptosis. Updated 7/2021",
