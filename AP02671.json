    "Literature": "Discovery: A short cecropin A-melittin hybrid peptide obtained by optimizing BP76 (sequence: KKLFKKILKFL). Other peptides with an optimal balance between antibacterial and hemolytic activities include BP66, BP77, BP81, BP105, BP125, and BP126 (see the ref).Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of BP100 most resembles (66.7% similarity)CM15.Activity: Highly active against E. amylovora (MIC 2.5-5.0 uM), X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria (MIC 5.0-7.5 uM), and P. syringae pv. syringae (MIC 2.5-5.0 uM).This peptide appears to have cell penetrating property (Eggenberger et al., 2011).MOA:bacteria:E. coli: it damaged bacterial membranes (Alves et al, 2010).Toxicity: exhibited low hemo.lytic activity (HC50>150 uM; 22% at 150 uM).Plant model:flowers: BP100 is highly active to prevent infections of plant pathogen E. amylovora in apple and pear flowers. It is only slightly less potent than streptomycin used in blight control.SAR: Another paper investigated the impact of D-amino acid incorporation, e.g. BP143 (a D-AA at position 4) and BP145 (a D-AA at position 2) (Guell et al., 2011). Peptide BP143 was as effective as streptomycin in the three pathosystems, was more effective than BP100 against bacterial blight of pepper and pear, and equally effective against fire blight of pear.Plant protection:apple: Plant protection:pear: flowers pretreated at 100 and 200 uM of BP100 reduced the infection of plant pathogen E. amylovora.
