    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE shows poor sequence similarity (60.3%) tocgMolluscidin. Constitutively expressed.Activity: This Ala (>25%) and Lys-rich peptide (43%) is active against B. subtilis KCTC1021, B. subtilis RM125, S. aureus RM4220,  E. coli D31, E. coli KCTC1116, P. aeruginosa KCTC2004, S. enterica KCTC2514, S. flexneri KCTC2517 (MEC 0.2-3.9 uM), fish pathogen A. hydrophila KCTC2358, and V. parahaemolyticus KCCM41664 (MEC 0.4-0.7 uM).  Not active against C.albicans (MEC > 250 uM). MEC (minimal effective concentration) to inhibit the bacterial growth in radial diffusion asssay by diluting the peptide every 2 fold as in the microdilution assay. No hemolysis at 100 ug/mL. May target an intracellular target. Updated 6/2019; 7/2021",
