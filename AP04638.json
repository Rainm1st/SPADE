    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (58.33%) toKR-12K: 42%, R: 33%, I: 17%.Activity:  active against Gram- E. coli KCTC 1682 (MIC 2 uM), P. aeruginosa KCTC 1637 (MIC 2 uM), S. typhimurium KCTC 1926 (MIC 2 uM), Gram+ B. subtilis KCTC 3068 (MIC 4 uM), S. epidermidis KCTC 1917 (MIC 2 uM), and S. aureus KCTC 1621 (MIC 4 uM). Warning: Non-standard assay.The peptide can also bind to LPS.In vitro toxicity: human RBC (HC50 >800 uM), not hemo.lytic.Structure:  random coil in 10 mM PBS and helical in 0.1% LPS. It is least helical in the entire peptide series.",
