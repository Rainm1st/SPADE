  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Active against E. coli RYC1000, E. coli B, E. coli F., E. coli ML35p, S. enterica Enteritidis, S. enterica Typhimurium, E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae (Vassiliadis G et al. 2010). The peptide lost its activity by amyloid formation (i.e. aggregates) (Bieler S et al 2005 JBC 280:26880).MOA:bacteria: It targets bacteria via the catecholate siderophore receptor to smuggle the AMP into bacteria (\"Trojan horse\" trick). Unmodified form (u-Mcc492) has been found (JBC 279: 28232-28242, 2004) but is inactive. Amyloid AMPs: More amyloid forms with the increase in u-Mcc492 (Marcoleta A et al., 2013).  The attachment of a trimer of N-(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)-L-serine  to the C-terminal Ser of MccE492 via glycosidic linkage led to Fe3+ binding capability (i.e. siderophore peptide) and enhanced antibacterial activity. The polypeptide core of Microcin E492 stably associates with the mannose permease and interferes with mannose metabolism (commented by Erni; Res Microbiol. 2010 Oct;161(8):706-10). The peptide also exists as non-toxic aggregates (amyloid formation) Updated 11/2010; 7/2011; 3/2014; 10/2023.",
