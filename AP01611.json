  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: Gallidermin differs from StT (a natural variant of this peptide) only by one base in the nucleotide sequence for the leader sequence. However, there is no difference at the amino acid level (Furmanek B et al. 1999 J Appl Microbiol 87: 856-866). Thus, they are treated as identical peptide in this database.Chemical modification:  Gallidermin contains four thioether rings (S3-C7, T8-C11, S16-C21, and S19-C22) and dehydrated T14.Activity: Active against S. aureus SG 511 or E88 (MIC 4-8 ug/ml), S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC 4 ug/ml), S. pneumonia ATCC 6302 (MIC 4 ug/ml), S. pyogenes ATCC 8668 (MIC 1 ug/ml), S. faecalis ATCC 29212 (MIC 64 ug/ml), C. xerosis ATCC 9755 (MIC 1 ug/ml), E.coli ATCC 11775 (MIC 128 ug/ml), P.aeruginosa BC 19 (MIC 128 ug/ml), M. luteus 15957 or ATCC 9341 (MIC 0.25-0.5 ug/ml), B.fragilis (Bonn) or (Koln) (MIC 128 ug/ml), P. anaerobicus (MIC 0.5 ug/ml), and P. acnes IF 31002 (MIC 0.125 ug/ml).    More active against a mprF mutant strain (Peschel  et al., 2001).MOA:bacteria:  Like epidermin and nisin, it also acts on lipid II. However, pore formation does not contribute to killing(Bonelli RR, et al. 2006). Updated 7/2021; 11/2023",
