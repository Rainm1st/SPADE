  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery:  Identified from the proteome by analyzing the peptides <10 kDa. Other LGHs do not have activity.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of LGH2 shows 40.9% similarity tofrog Temporin-RN3.20% F; 20% L; 10% P and 10% K. Mol Wt: 2447.951; GRAVY: 0.28;  mol formula: C123H181N28O24. MainlyActivity: Active against Gram+ bacteria S. aureus ATCC 29213 (MIC 4 uM), L. monocytogenes ATCC 7611 (MIC 4 uM), L. casei HZ1 (MIC 32 uM) and Gram- E. aerogenes ATCC 13048 (MIC 64 uM). Inactive: K.pneumoniae ATCC 700603 (MIC>256 uM), fungi  S.cerevisiae (MIC>256 uM) and P.pastoris (MIC>256 uM).Toxicity: HC50=50% hemolytic concentration ~40 uM (sheep RBC): moderate hemolytic.Structure: The helical structure observed in 10 mM SDS or 50% TFE can be responsible for the activity and cytotoxicity.
