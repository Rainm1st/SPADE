    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: This peptide is highly similar in sequence to Ranatuerin-2CSa. It may be predicted to have a helix-turn-helix motif as well. This structure may explain its high potency against a panel of G- and G+ bacteria (MIC < 20 uM).Activity: Active against E. coli (MIC 5 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 5 uM), E. cloacae (MIC 5 uM),  K. pneumoniae (MIC 10 uM), S. aureus (MIC 20 uM), S. epidermidis (MIC 20 uM),  Streptococcus Group B (MIC 20 uM), P-mirabilis (MIC >40 uM), E-faecalis (MIC >40 uM), and C-albicans (MIC >40 uM).In vitro toxicity: Hemo.lytic HC50 290 uM.Updated  9/2014; 5/2019; 7/2021; 12/2024",
