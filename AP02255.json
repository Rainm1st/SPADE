    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: The APD calculated Mol Wt: 11247.852, mol formula: C502H788N128O152S5, and mol ex coeff: 17185 (cys paired). Theoretical pI of the mature peptide is 6.09.Host expression:  The scygonadin gene was predominantly expressed in the male reproductive tract of S. serrata and was restricted to the ejaculatory duct. Not induced by LPS but expressed during mating, thereby related to reproductive immunity (Xu et al., 2011).Activity: Using recombinant protein, in vitro activity assays revealed that it is active against Gram-negative A. hydrophila (MIC 30-60 uM), P. fluorescens (MIC 12.5-25 uM), S. flexneri (MIC 25-50 uM), E-coli (MIC >50 uM), V-harveyi (MIC >50 uM), Gram-positive M. luteus (MIC 6.25-12.5 uM), S. aureus (MIC 6.25-12.5 uM), B. subtilis (MIC 25-50 uM), C. glutamicum (MIC 12.5-25 uM), B-cereus (MIC > 50 uM), and S. epidermidis (MIC>50 uM), Filamentous fungi A-niger (MIC >50 uM), F-solani (MIC >50 uM), yeast C-candida (MIC>50 uM), and P-pastoris GS115 (MIC>50 uM) (Peng et al. 2010).Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-insensitive:A. hydrophila (200 mM) (however, low level 100 mM salt is tolerated).Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: fused with SmbP at the N-terminus, metal affinity purification, yield: 20 mg/L (monomer) and 30 mg/L (tandem) (Gomez-Lugo et al., 2024.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: yield: 32.7 mg/L expressed with thioredoxin and 29.2 mg/L fused with SUMO (Li 2013).Recombinant production:yeast:Pichia pastoris: optimal expression with 0.5% methan-ol for 48 h at 28 Â°C under pH 6.0; recombiant peptide yield (97% pure): 46 mg/L (Peng et al., 2012). Recombinant peptide from yeast was more active than that expressed from E. coli.Updated 5/2014; 2/2024.",
