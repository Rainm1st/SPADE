    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals the sequence is most similar (77.6%) toAnAFP. Interestingly, the same sequence has also been found in a different species in a 2018 paper that determined activity and structure of the peptide (Huber et al., 2018). Active against Filamentous fungi A. fumigatus, A. niger, A. terreus, N. crassa, P. chrysogenum, T. rubrum, yeasts C. albicans and S. cerevisiae (MIC 0.12-1 uM). In addition, two N-terminal residues (1-2) truncated forms were also detected. NMR analysis corresponds to the short form with 56 amino acids (sfPAFB).You can rotate, zoom, and view the Greek key-like beta sheet structureherein the PDB. The structure is predicted in the previous paper (see ref). Found in multiple species. Updated 6/2018 GW.",
