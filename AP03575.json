    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (70.97%) toVicBacP: 20%; R: 25%. a Pro-rich like peptide. Possibly disulfide bond formation.  Mol. Wt: 2516.108; GRAVY: -0.44; Mol Formula: C111H183N37O24S3; mol ex coeff: 0. Spampcin is likely an AMP with 153 amino acids (no activity is known). However, the fragment is active.Activity: active against Gram+ S. aureus (MIC 6-12 uM), L. monocytogenes (MIC 3-6 uM), E. faecalis (MIC 3-6 uM), E. faecium (MIC 3-6 uM), S. epidermidis (MIC 6-12 uM), Gram- P. aeruginosa (MIC 6-12 uM), E. coli (MIC 6-12 uM), A. baunmannii (MIC 6-12 uM), fungi C. neoformans (MFC 3-6 uM), F. graminearum (MFC 12-24 uM), F. solani (MFC 12-24 uM), A. niger (MFC 12-24 uM). Compared to Spa31, this further shortened peptide became less active against numerous strains. Jan2023",
