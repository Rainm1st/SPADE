  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (84.62%) toKn2-7R: 38%, I: 23%, L=F: 15%.Activity: active against S. aureus ATCC 29212 or MRSA (MIC 5 ug/ml), S. epidermidis (MIC 2.5-5.0 ug/ml),  E. faecalis (MIC 5-10 ug/ml),  E. faecium (MIC 2.5 ug/ml), and E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 10 ug/ml).In vitro toxicity: HC50 < 100 ug/ml, hemolytic (see ref).SAR:  the peptide activity reduced by 2 fold against Salmonella without C-terminal amidation. However, hemolysis reduced dramatically without C-terminal amidation (HC50 886.50 uM) compared to amidated form Kn2-5R-NH2 (HC50 67.09 uM). (Mangmee et al., 2021). Hence, Kn2-5R may be of interest for further studies",
