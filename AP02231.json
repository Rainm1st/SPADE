    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: Gly-rich short peptides from the C-terminal region (residues 515-559) of human keratin 6a =K6a.AMP Significance: Mild Keratin 6A knockdown in mouse cornea led to a substantial increase of bacterial colonization on the otherwise normal ocular surface.Activity: Active against P. aeruginosa. Because the short active fragments contain part of the 19mer sequence, they are all collected in the same entry here to increase the uniqueness of the database peptides.Antimicrobial robustness: the activity is salt-insensitive. The 13mer is as active against P. aeruginosa as the 19-mer, suggesting the Gly-rich domain is essential.Structure:  The 3D structure of KAMP-19 has been determined in the presence of SDS micelles.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.The amino acid sequeces of these fragments are below:KAMP-18N, the 18-mer-N (sequence: AIGGGLSSVGGGSSTIKY);KAMP-18C: the 18-mer-C (sequence: RAIGGGLSSVGGGSSTIK);KAMP-17 (sequence:   AIGGGLSSVGGGSSTIK);KAMP-14 (sequence: GGGLSSVGGGSSTIK);KAMP-13 (sequence: AIGGGLSSVGGGS);KAMP-10 (sequence: GGLSSVGGGS).Read the comments of this workhere.
