  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: 72% similar to IG-25 (AP02855), a C-terminal fragment of LL-37 studied by NMR (Li et al., 2006).Chemical modification: N-terminal acetylation (XXE);Activity: 24 h incubation: Active against E. coli ATCC 8739 (MIC 2 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027 (MIC 3 uM), C. albicans ATCC 10231 (MIC 6 uM), and A. niger ATCC 14406 (MIC18 uM). Acetylation (XXE) did not influence peptide activity (see ref). It also inhibited MRSA clinical strains and biofilm formation (Ming and Huang, 2017).SAR:  N-terminal acetylation did not influence peptide activity (see ref).Toxicity: Ototoxicity was measured in guinea pigs. Peptide P60.4-Ac (2 mg/ml) in PBS induced a threshold change of -7 dB 22 days after surgery (cf.: cisplatin caused -49 and -64 dB threshold changes).Clinical trials: OP-145 is 24mer derived from P60.4 (derived from IG-24). It is in the phase II clinical trials as a treatment for chronic middle ear infection.Peptide engineering:  This peptide has been further advanced to SAAP-148 (AP02875).Clinical trials: more info needed.
