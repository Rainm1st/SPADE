  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis revealed that this N-terminal sequence has a net charge -6, which is out of the predicted range defined for AMPs in the APD. Since the longer form is much less active, it is likely this cleaved form is the AMP. Inhibits A. hydrophila Infection.Activity: Active against both Gram+ S. aureus, M. luteus, and Gram- bacteira E. coli.",
