  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide shows 93% similarity toBacteriocin 31.Activity:  Plasmid-encoded bacteriocin is active against the indicator strain E. durans 41D-S1, L. monocytogenes strains, including nisin-resistant L. monocytogenes NR30. Both durancin GL and bacteriocin 31 pre-peptides include leader sequences that are recognized by a sec-dependent translocation system and do not require bacteriocin-specific translocation proteins. Thus, other LAB strains possessing a sec-dependent transmembrane transport system may also be suitable hosts for the production of durancin GL. Alanine scanclearly influeces peptide activity (Ju X et al., 2015).",
