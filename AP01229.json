  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "The C-terminal 13 residues are identical to MccV (AP01228). Like MccV, MccL has a S-S bond between C78 and C89. However, one additional S-S bond can form between residues C29 and C33.  MOA: It targets bacterial membranes and induces ion channel formation, leading to the disruption of the proton-motive force and hence ATP production.",
