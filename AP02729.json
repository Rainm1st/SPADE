  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE shows poor sequence similarity (52%) toScorpion VpAmp2.0.Activity: Active against B. subtilis NCIMB 8024, S. epidermidis sp., S. aureus SH100 (MIC 4-8 ug/ml), E. coli JM109 (MIC 64 ug/ml), and  C. albicans (MIC 32 ug/ml).Structure: The peptide can adopt a helical conformation in 60% TFE, laying a basis for memrbane targeting.Toxicity:  it showed toxicity to mammalian cells (cancer or non-cancer).MOA:cancer:  The peptide appears to activate a cascade of events leading to cell death via inducing caspase-1 dependent pyroptosis as indicated by the release of IL-1beta (Elrayess et al., 2022). Removal of the N-terminal four residues increases peptide cell selectivity. Updated 9/2016; Jan2022",
