    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (68.42%) toTpen-cecA=K: 16%. GRAVY: -0.259; mol Wt: 4080.89; mol formula: C186H309N56O45S1; mol ex coeff: 5550.Activity: active against Gram- bacteria E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 1 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 2 uM), Y-pestis KIM6+ (MIC > 63 uM), Y. pestisKIM6+arnOP gene deleted (MIC 2 uM), Gram+ S-aureus ATCC 29213 (MIC > 63 uM), and E-faecalis ATCC 29212 (MIC > 63 uM).MOA:bacteria:Y. pestis: only permeabilized the membranes of the mutant strain of Y. pestis.Structure:  random coil in water and helical in SDS micelles.Resistance mechanism: Deletion of thearnoperon, which is responsible for Ara4N modification of LPS (leading to positive LPS), rendered Y. pestis susceptible to both cecropins and polymyxin B. Complementation with an intactarnoperon restored bacterial resistance.AMP significance: Why fleas can carry Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, without killing it? This study revealed the crucial role of Ara4N modification of Y. pestis LPS (making it more basic) to confer resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides of flea.Deposited and provided by Basil Mathew.
