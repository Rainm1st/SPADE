  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Peptide synthesis:  a 27mer was made with C-terminal amidation (implied by last G).Activity: Active against E. coli ATCC 25922 ML-35 or D21 (MIC 0.5-2 uM), S. typhimurium ATCC 14028 (MIC 1 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 1 uM), S. marcescens ATCC 8100 (MIC 2 uM), S. aureus ATCC 25923 or Cowan 1 MRSA (MIC 1-4 uM), S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC 1 uM), B. megaterium Bm11 (MIC 1 uM), C. albicans (MIC 8 uM), and C. neoformans (MIC 4 uM).Toxicity:  HC50 < 100 uM to hRBC (at 100 uM, 90% hemolysis). However, lower hemolysis to bovine RBC BMAP-28 (3, 6, and 22% hemolysis at 10, 30, and 100 mM peptide).MOA:bacteria: BMAP-27 and BMAP-28 both induce a rapid permeabilization of the inner bacterial membrane.Animal model:mouse: BMAP-28 has broad antimicrobial activities and confers protection in a mouse model of bacterial infection or sepsis (Giacometti A et al. 2004 Crit Care Med 32, 2485-90). Furthermore, BMAP-28 and its isomers demonstrated anti-leishmanial activities against intracellular L. major amastigotes within a macrophage infection model.SAR: Its activity is comparable to the parent peptide, indicating that the hydrophobic tail is not essential for the antibacterial nor for the antifungal activity. Also, the D-amino acid form is more active against parasites than either BMAP-28 (the L form) or the sequence reversed form (Lynn MA et al 2011 PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 5(5):e1141). Trucation of the C-terminal tail  reduced hemolysis.  Of note, a modified peptide (mBMAP-28) was also synthesized by replacing the C-terminal hydrophobic tail (residues 20-28) with a more hydrophilic sequence QATPATRQ also reduced peptide cell selectivity. BMAP-28 is also antiviral (e.g., simplex virus type 1, HSV-1) (Benincasa et al., 2003). Updated 7/2011; 12/2017.",
