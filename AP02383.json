    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: This single residue analog is 95.24% similar to its parent molecule (AP00727). R: 33%; V: 19%; Y: 14%; C=W: 10%. GRAVY: -0.48; M.Wt: 2817.398; mol formula: C128H200N44O25S2.Activity: Active against S. aureus strain 209P (MIC 6.25 uM), E. coli strain C600 (1.56 uM), and P. aeruginosa PAO1 (MIC 1.56 uM).Structure: similar to the WT.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Toxicity: This peptide became much less hemo.lytic (sellectivity improved by 50 fold with similar activity) than its parent peptide due to reduced hydrophobicity. 10% hemolysis at 125 uM (cf. 4.1 uM for the WT). Not hemo.lytic.The original has been merged with AP2382. Updated 7/2021; 2/2023.",
