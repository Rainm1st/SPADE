    "Literature": "Host expression: Constitutively expressed in all tested tissues including the adductor muscle, mantle, hepatopancreas, gill, gonads and hemocytes. Two and 8 h after bacterial challenge, the highest levels were observed in hemocytes and adductor muscle (p < 0.01).Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the net charge of this sequence is out of the core parameter space.
