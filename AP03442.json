    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (41.38%) topredicted SM-9857R=26%; 5L=19%, 3F=3W=3P=11%. GRAVY:  -0.011; M. Wt: 3575.397; Mol formula: C175H264N51O29S1; Mol Ex Coeff: 18202.5;Activity:  Antimicrobial: active against Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 29213 or MRSA WKZ-2 (MIC 5 uM), B. globigii TNO BMO13 (MIC 5 uM), Gram- E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 10 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 10 uM); P. aeruginosa PAO1 (MIC 20 uM), and S. enteriditis 706 RIVM (MIC 10 uM). Anti-inflammatory: 5 or 20 uM peptide reduced the production of NO and IL-6 induced by 50 ng/ml LPS after preincubation with RAW 264.7 cells for 24 h.Structure: CD: 25 uM peptide is disordered in water and becomes helical (52.6%) in 40% TFE, bacterial LPS (30.8-32.1%), or LTA (33%) based on CD. The conformational change results from a direct binding of Escherichia coli LPS, LPS was fully bound at 25 uM (Limulus amaebocyte lysate assay). NMR: 3D structure determined in the presence of 30% TFE-d3/70% H2O, 25oC.Toxicity: did not show hemo-lytic till 40 uM. Did not significantly reduce cell viability of mouse macrophages RAW 264.7 cells, human HaCaT or HeLa cells after 24 h incubation till 40 uM.Kinetics in serum:  t1/2= 1-2 h, 6% left after 24 h.",
