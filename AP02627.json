    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide most resembles (43.6% similarity)Mj-AMP2. Mol Wt: 3590.266; mol formula: C148H246N46O45S6; GRAVY: 0.28.  Its activity was more than 500 times higher against bacterial than against eukaryotic cells. Active against S. aureus (MBC 1.25 uM), E. coli (MBC 0.31 uM), and P. aeruginosa (MBC 10 uM, 99% death; 80 uM for 100% death). Ep-AMP1 targets bacterial membranes.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. Activity provided by the authors.",
