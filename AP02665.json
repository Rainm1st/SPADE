  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide most resembles (56.7% similarity)Scygonadin. Mol. Wt: 10907.51; GRAVY=-0.008. Active against Gram+ bacteria B. subtilis, M. lysodeikticus,  M. luteus, C. glutamicum (MIC 12.5-50 uM), but not Gram- bacteria until 50 uM. A peak expression of SCY2 corresponds to the mating peaks of male and female crabs. Thus, this peptide, along with SCY1, could protect the fertilization process from invading pathogens.",
