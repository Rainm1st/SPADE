  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "~82% similar toAP2203:daptomycin. The authors used a transformation-associated recombination (TAR)-based genetic platform to directly clone, refactor, and heterologously express a silent biosynthetic pathway to yield a new antibiotic analog ofdaptomycin. The marine actinomycete Saccharomonospora sp. CNQ-490 TAR gene cluster was successfully expressed. Taromycin A differs from Daptomycin only in serveal places: 1) residue T11 is an D-Ala; 2) W is chlorinated at position 6; 3)  Kny is also chlorinated at position 4; and 4) it carried an octa-2,4-dienoyl lipid side chain. Warning: the sequence is a close mimic of the natural counterpart.  For example, kynurenine-13 (Kyn) is represented by Y here. Refer to daptomycin for more details. Active against MRSA 0325 (MIC 12 ug/ml), E. faecalis 613, E. faecalis 447 (MIC 6 ug/ml),  E. faecalis 613D,  E. faecium 447D (MIC 50 ug/ml), and VRE 5938 (100 ug/ml) (anti-VRE).  It is a potential lead. UPdated 9/2017.",
