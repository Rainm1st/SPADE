    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide shows 35.7% similarity toP5.Chemical modification: R2, R7, Q9, and W10 are D-amino acids (XXD). The amide proton of F5 is methylated (XXM). The amide of T1 is acylated (XXL). The sidechain OH of T1 forms an ester bond with the carboxyl group of T12 (XXJ), leading to a macrolactone.Activity: Active against S. aureus MRSA (MIC 4 ug/ml),  methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) (MIC 1-4 ug/ml), lab-generated vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (MIC 8 ug/ml), Bacillus spp. (MIC 2 ug/ml), L. monocytogenes (MIC 1 ug/ml), and Mycobacterium spp. (MIC 8 ug/ml). Inactive against E.coli, P.aeruginosa, S.marcescens, and C.neoformans (Panthee et al., 2017).MOA: Lysocin E interacted with menaquinone in the bacterial membrane to kill bacteria. This is a novel mode of action different from that of any other known antibiotic, indicating that lysocin E comprises a new class of antibiotic.Synergy: Surprisingly, serum can enhance the activity of Lysocin E. In vitro, human apolipoprotein A-I increases peptide activity. Also, antimicrobial activity of lysocin E is reduced in apoA-I gene KO mice. It appears that both apoA-I and bacterial lipid II can potentiate the activity of lysocin E (Hamamoto et al., 2021).Animal model:mouse: The EC50 of the peptide (0.5 mg/kg) is even less than that of vancomycin (5.8 mg/kg), a known peptide antibiotic for MRSA treatment. Remarkably, Lysocin E did not display acute toxicity in mice at a dose up to 400 mg/kg.  It is a potential lead. The original artificial peptidde has been replaced 09/2020; 7/2021; 4/2022",
