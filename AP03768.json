  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: S9 splits the hydrophobic surface of LL-37. SK-24 corresponds to the central helix starting S9.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (88.89%) toHuman KS-27K: 21%; R: 13%; I: 13%. GRAVY: -0.69;Activity: Active against E. faecium V284-17 (MIC 2 uM), S. aureus USA300 (MIC 4 uM), K-pneumoniae E406-17 (MIC>32 uM). A. baumannii B28-16 (MIC 4-8 uM), P-aeruginosa E411-17 (MIC > 32 uM), and E. coli E423-17 (MIC 16 uM). It also disperse preformed biofilms.Structure: Like LL-37, SK-24 is helical even in PBS, more helical than that after binding to SDS.MOA:bacteria: it permeabilized bacterial membranes.Toxicity: it was least hemo.lytic (HC50 > 200 uM) compared to LL-37 and its fragments, including 17BIPHE2 at 200 uM.",
