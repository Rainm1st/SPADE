    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (57.14%) toBrevinin-2CEActivity: The peptide is virucidal against both Zika virus (ZIKV) (D=L) and dengue viruses (DENV). Yodha peptide efficiently inhibited DENV1 (IC50 25 uM), DENV2 (IC50 2 uM), DENV3 (IC50 70 uM), and DENV4 (IC50 30 uM).Toxicity:  not hemo.lytic at 160 uM to hRBC.Animal model:mouse:  C57BL/6: D-Yodha was IP injected 5 h before infection in the footpad with 100,000 focus forming units of ZIKV strain PRVABC. After peptide injection daily for 3 days, viral load was reduced.",
