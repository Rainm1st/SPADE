    "Literature": "Toxic to Golden apple snails, serious pests of rice in South East Asia. Trp can be oxidized into N-formylkynurenine (nfk) or kynurenine (Kyn). The effect of this oxidation on peptide activity is unknown (Plan MR et al. Chembiochem 8: 1001-11). Moderately active against S. aureus (MIC 50 uM) and also reduced bacterial load in vivo (Fensterseifer IC et al., 2014). Also, inactive against E.coli (MIC >160 uM), P.aeruginosa (MIC 160 uM), S.aureus (MIC >160 uM), C.albicans (MIC >160 uM) (Strömstedt et al., 2017). Also, MIC was reported to be 35 uM  performed in 10 mM PBS supplemented with 0.1% TSB\nin 96-microwell plates (Pränting M et al., 2010).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.
