    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide most resembles (87.2% similarity)Ir-Def2 from the same species. Mol Wt: 4525.38; Mol Extinction coeff 4845; mol formula: C197H307N63O48S6. Active against L. monocytogenes (MIC 15 uM), L. fleischmannii  (MIC 60 uM), L. grayi  (MIC 8 uM) and L. seeligeri  (MIC 15 uM), S. aureus  (MIC 60 uM), and Gram- P. aeruginosa  (MIC 30 uM). In addition, it completely inhibited the germination of  fungi F. culmorum (IC50 4 uM) and F. graminearum (IC50 4 uM).  Note that DefMT3 and DefMT4 are isoforms that share 98% identity at the nucleotide and protein levels and they have identical mature peptide sequences, suggesting they have the same activity.",
