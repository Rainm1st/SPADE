I: 27%.Activity: active against E.coli D21 (MIC >100 ug/ml), A.calcoaceticus Ac11 (MIC >100 uM), P.aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC >100 uM), S.typhirnuriunz LT2 (MIC >100 uM), B. megateriurn Bm11 (MIC 12.5 uM), M. luteus ATCC 9341 (MIC 100 uM), and B. subtilis ATCC 6051 (MIC 40 uM).SAR: C-terminal amidation increased activity. Amidation increases helical structure stability.",
