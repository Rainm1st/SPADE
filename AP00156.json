    "Literature": "Discovery: Isolated from baboon leukocytes.Activity: Diffusion assays indicates activity against E. coli ML35, S. aureus 502a, and C. albicans 16820. Active against drug resistant C. albicans clinical isolates (MIC 1.56-12.5 ug/ml) (Basso et al., 2018).MOA:  It disrupts E. coli membranes.Structure: The molecule shows concentration-dependent self aggregation into trimers in water. It adopts the typical rigid beta-hirpin structure (Conibear AC et al., 2012).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. There is alsoa crystal structure. NMR+X.
