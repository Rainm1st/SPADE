    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence  is 69.2% similar toscorpion Hp1036. Activity for the entire two-domain molecule has not been demonstrated. A synthetic peptide (Jan-f3) corresponding to the N-temrinal 35 amino acids was found to be active against F. culmorum and F. oxysporum (IC50 8.8 and 10.04 uM). It is also active against E. coli JM109. A shorter fragment with 9 residues (Jan-f1) was inactive.",
