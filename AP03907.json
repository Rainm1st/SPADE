  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: purified by ethyl acetate extraction followed by chromatographical methods (e.g. ion exchange and HPLC).Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is poorly similar (41.67%) toSAAP. V=D: 25%.Activity: inhibition zone assay: +++ > 20 mm; ++ = 14â€“20 mm; + < 14 mm; - = none. Active against Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 29213 (++), B. subtilis CMCC 63501 (++), B. equi CICC 22955 (++), B. cereus CMCC 63301 (+), S. haemolyticus CMCC 32210 (++), P. acnes ATCC 6919 (++), Gram- S. paratyphi CMCC 50094 (++), V. parahaemolyticus ATCC 33847 (++), P. foulis ATCC 49128 (++), E. aerogenes CMCC 45103 (+++), Fungi F. sylvaticum BNCC 356200  (++), and A. fumigatus CICC 41022 (++). Microdilution assay: active against L. monocytogenes ATCC 19111 (MIC 31.25 ug/ml).Antimicrobial robustness: thermal stable 40-100oC; pH 2-7; but degraded by proteases. In  the rpesence of 1-2 xMIC peptide, listerial CFU was reduced by less than 2 log in chicken breast (food preservative).",
