    "Literature": "host protease cleavage: Protease-cleaved product of LL-37 in human sweat. The active fragment appeared to be short-lived in vitro since it reduced with time and became not detectable after 24 h.Activity: Active against S. aureus mprF (KO) (diffusion assays), C. albicans. It also reduced the viability of T. vaginalis on a 5-nitroimidazole-sensitive and a 5-nitroimidazole-resistant strain (Ram√≠rez-Ledesma et al., 2022).Structure:  Structure is predicted to be helical based on NMR studies of intact LL-37 and its fragments in micelles.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: a bacterial expression system has been established for this peptide (Li etal., 2007).
