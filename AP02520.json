    "Literature": "AMP Significance:  In the gastrointestinal and oral microbiome, both Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans co-exist and antagonize each other.  Interestingly, Enterococcus faecalis can secret the same bacteriocin (named EntV) to inhibit C. albicans and its biofilm formation (Brown et al., 2019).Sequence analysis: 36.25% SIMILAR TOhistone-derived Oncorhyncin IIIEnterocin O16 includes the C-terminal 68 residues of the EF1097 precursor protein. The protease GelE is responsible for the release of this bacteriocin.  With two Cys residues, there may be a disulfide bond.Activity: A narrow-spectrum peptide with MIC in the range of nM. Active against L. sakei LMG 2313 or LMG 3354 or LMG 3355 or LMG 3356 or LMG 3357 (MIC 0.5-500 ng/ml),  and L. plantarum LMG 2003 (MIC 31 ng/ml).Structure:  determined using single anomalous dispersion (SAD) phasing to 1.8 Ã… resolution. There are seven helical regions in the crystal structure.Animal model:Caenorhabditis elegans: 0.1 nM EntV completely protected nematode Caenorhabditis elegans from C. albicans infection, and increased fungal clearance by murine macrophages (Graham et al., 2017).Half-life in vitro:serum:  about 10% remaining after 4 h of incubation in 10% serum.SAR: a 12mer of the alpha7 helix, retaining a full three turns of the alpha-helix and ending with cysteine-167, is as effective in protecting against C. albicans infection in the worm model and inhibiting surface adhesion as full-length EntV. The active fragments of helix 7 are also registered into the APD (Cruz et al., 2022).Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: The peptide was expressed and purifed for SAR studies.Updated 7/2019; SAR 5/2024.",
