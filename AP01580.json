    "Literature": "Host expression:induced: bacteria can induce its expression.Activity: Active against HIV-1 and HSV-2 (Drannik AG, et al 2013). The anti-HIV activity of Elafin is 130 times more potent than its precursor serine antiprotease trappin-2  (Drannik AG, et al 2012).It is also antiparasitic and malaria (Roussilhon et al., 2017).Structure:You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Updated 11/2014; 2/2017; 4/2025 GW.",
