    "Literature": "Metal coordination: the N-terminal amine, the three imidazoles of H1, H6, and H9 participate in the coordination of Zn(II) (Dudek et al., 2020).Sequence analysis:  It is a classic His-rich peptide (25%). It's N-terminally truncated form of alloferon 1.Activity: During screening, it was found to be cytotoxic against cancer cells but not further chracterized yet. Updated 9/2017; 12/2017; 6/2022",
