    "Literature": "AMP Significance: Rnase6 deficiency (i.e., Rnase6EGFP/EGFP) resulted in increased upper urinary tract UPEC burden during experimental UTI, compared to Rnase6+/+ controls (Cortado et al., 2024).Discovery: The amino acids sequence was reported by Dyer KD et al. 2004 (J Mol Evol. 2004 Nov; 59:657-65). 39.53% similar toAP2073 RNase 7.Host expression:induced: The expression of this AMP is inducible.Activity: In 2014, the  Spencer lab demonstrated its antimicrobial activity against uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), E. faecalis, and S. saprophyticus at micromolar concentrations, comparable to RNase 7.SAR: This peptide has stronger antibacterial activity (e.g., E. coli), LPS binding and bacteria-agglutinating ability compared to a natural variant with a glutamine at position 66 (Refer to AP04036).Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: expressed in the BL21 AI strain and purified from inclusion bodies and refolded via dialysis. The recombinant peptide has a sequence corresponding to the sequence of the native peptide (personal communication to Dr. Spencer).Structure:You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Update 4/2016; 8/2023; Jan2024; 5/2024; 2/2025.",
