    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 53% similarity toTur1A. molecular formula: C197H293N55O37; Mol Wt: 4032.812; GRAVY = -1.Activity: Active against E. coli BW25113 (MIC 7 uM). The peptide also contains multiple Trp (althought not rich <25%). Its mechanism of action appears to be different from Tur1B.  3/2018; 7/2021.",
