  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (84.62%) toBmKn2K7K: 38%, I: 23%, L=F: 15%.Activity: active against S. aureus ATCC 29212 or MRSA (MIC 5 ug/ml), S. epidermidis (MIC 2.5-5.0 ug/ml),  E. faecalis (MIC 5-10 ug/ml), E. faecium (MIC 5 ug/ml), and E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 5 ug/ml).MOA:bacteria:S. aureus: acted on bacterial membranes.Structure: random coil in water and become helical in 30% or 70% TFE.In vitro toxicity: HC50 > 100 ug/ml. 10% hemolysis at 100 ug/ml, less hemo.lytic. This lysine analog is much less hemolytic than the arginine analog (this study) since arginine is more hydrophobic (Mishra et al., 2013). In addition, the peptide is not toxic to human HEK293T and mouse fibroblast cells L929.In vivo toxicity:mouse: 80 mg/kg caused 50% animal death.Animal model:mouse: ip infected S. aureus or A. baumannii, 0.5 hpi, IP treated 20 mg/kg, all mice surviced during 7 days observation (ctr group died in 24 h). Thus, the peptide protected mice from death and also reduced CFU in peritoneal fluids.",
