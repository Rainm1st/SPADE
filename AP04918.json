    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (53.33%) toI14M thanatinR: 33%, C: 17%. GRAVY: -1.49; mol Wt: 1642.97.Activity: active against S. aureus ATCC 29213 or MRSA (MIC 64 ug/ml),  10 methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis MRSE (MIC 2-8 ug/ml), S. haemolyticus XJ31196 or 3 more strains (MIC 2-8 ug/ml), and S. hominis XJ31287 and 3 more strains (MIC 2-8 ug/ml).Inhibited biofilm formation:bacteria:S. epidermidis at 0.5 MIC.In vitro toxicity: human RBC 10%, not hemo.lytic at 512 ug/ml, not toxic to human umbilical vein endothelial cells at 1024 ug/ml.MOA:bacteria:S. epidermidis:  permeated bacterial membranes (PI).Resistance development:no:bacteria:S. epidermidis: MIC did not increase after 15 passages. Cf: MIC values of antibiotics (erythromycin, ceftriaxone, and oxacillin) increased by 8-64 fold.Antimicrobial robustness:  MIC retained after incubation with 50% plasma for 3 and 6 h (serum-insensitive?).Animal model:rat: urinary tract-infection model, stent inserted into bladder via surgery, infected with MRSE strain XJ75284, treated with the peptide after 16 or 28 h, CFU decreased in bladder, kidney, and stent was obsrved in a dose-dependent manner (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg).Updated 4/2025",
