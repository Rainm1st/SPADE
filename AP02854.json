  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide shows 52.1% similarity tosheep OaBac5. 45% PROLINE. Molecular formula:  C219H302N59O41; Mol Wt 4416.181; GRAVY=  -1.28; Wimley-White whole-residue hydrophobicity of the peptide:  2.97  kcal/mol. A synthetic form is active against M. luteus ATCC9341 (MIC 0.78-1.56 uM), S. Typhimurium ATCC13311 (MIC 3.1-6.2 uM), E. coli ATCC35218 (MIC 12.5-25 uM), V. harveyi (MIC 0.195-0.39 uM), and V. parahaemolyticus ATCC17802 (MIC 3.1-6.2 uM). Recombinant peptide only showed activity against M. luteus ATCC9341 (MIC 3.1-6.2 uM) and  V. harveyi (MIC 1.56-3.13 uM). The reasons may be multiple and a possible sequence modification cannot not be excluded.",
