  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Warning: the reported sequence is incomplete.   BacFL31 was purified to homogeneity by four purification steps (heat treatment 15 min at 90 \u0002C, 60% ammonium sulphate precipitation, gel filtration Sephadex G25, and reverse phase HPLC). It is usual that even in the N-terminal 23 residues sequenced, six prolines at positions 6,9,12,15,18, and 21 are hydroxylated (XXK).  Active against L. monocytogenes. It may be developed into a food preservative.",
