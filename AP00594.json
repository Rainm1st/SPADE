    "Literature": "Structure:You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.MOA:bacteria:  It interacts with cell wall by binding to lipid II(Martínez B 2008). It has been noticed that bacteria can remodling the cell wall compoents to achieve resistance to Lcn972. In particular, the peptidoglycan of the mutants featured a higher content of muropeptides with tripeptide side chains than the wild-type strain, linking for the first time peptidoglycan remodelling to bacteriocin resistance. Moreover, L. lactis lacking a functional D,D-carboxypeptidase DacA (i.e., with a high content of pentapeptide side chain muropeptides) was shown to be more susceptible to Lcn972 (Roces et al., 2012).The original entry has been replaced 8/22/2012; updated 2/2014; 8/2014.",
