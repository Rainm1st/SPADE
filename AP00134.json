    "Literature": "Discovery: Initially thought from pig (see the ref), this AMP is actually synthesized by a roundworm in pigs (Andersson M et al 2003 Cell Mol Life Sci 60: 599-606).Activity: Active against Gram- L. anguillarum (MIC 1.2 uM), E. coli (MIC 1.2 uM), Gram+ C. glutamicum (MIC 1.6 uM), and S. aureus (MIC 12.5 uM). Also: Active against Gram+ S. aureus 930918-3 (MIC 22.2 ug/ml),  E. faecalis CDC 21, L. monocytogenes EGD (MIC 3-9.4 ug/ml), Gram-  E. coli ML-35p, E. coli mcr 106, E. coli BAS 849, S. typhimurium 14028S, S. enterica serovar typhimurium 7953S, K. pneumoniae 2270, P. aeruginosa SBI-N, P. aeruginosa MR2123, and P. aeruginosa MR3007 (MIC 0.3-0.5 ug/ml) (Lee IH et al., 1997). Also  Active against colistin-susceptible A. baumannii (MIC 1.6 ug/ml or >25 resitant strain) but less active against the resistant strain (MIC >25 ug/ml) (Vila-Farres X et al Clin Microb Infect 18: 383-7).Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-insensitive:E. coli till 300 mM NaCl (Lee et al., 1997).SAR: activity reduced significantly when W2 was substituted. Also retarded DNA band at a peptide-to-DNA molar ratio of 64,000:1, more than CP1(1-29), indicating the C-terminus is likely involved in DNA binding and providing an interpretation for higher expression of CP1(1-29).Structure: The structure of cecropin P1 in 30% (by vol.) 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol solution, was determined by proton-NMR (Sipos D et al. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209:163-169). It has a long helix followed by C-terminal tail.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3Dstructure bound to DPC micellesin the PDB. This 1H NMR determined structure has been confirmed by heteronuclear 15N NOE (Gu et al., 2022). Like human LL-37, the C-terminus of CP1 is disordered and mobile when bound to DPC.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: expressed as soluble protein when fused with calmodulin. Probably due to binding to calmodulin (Cf. a low yiled when fused with thioredoxin, Trx), this system minimized the toxicity to the host.Surface immobilized peptide: TBA.Transgenic plants: expression of this peptide in tobacco increases resistance of the plant to microbial pathogens (Genetika. 2009 Aug;45(8):1061-6).
