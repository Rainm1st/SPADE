    "Literature": "Active against S. aureus 502a, E. coli ML 35, and C. albicans 16820. RTD-1 and RTD-5 are 3-fold more active than RTD-4. RTD-6 has not be collected due to the lack of activity data. Chemical synthesis and purification of RTD-6 turned out to be more difficult than other RTD defensins.",
