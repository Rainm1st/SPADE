    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (35.48%) toDefensin 1. A: 13%. GRAVY: 0.41; M Wt: 9475.141; M formula:  C413H667N107O124, mol ex coeff: 1927.5. It contains seven cysteines. May form dimers.Activity: activity was demonstrated by both agar diffusion assay and microdilution assays. Active against  S. aureus ATCC25923 (MIC 60 ug/ml), E.coli ATCC25922 (MIC >160 ug/ml), and  C.albicans CMCC(F)98001 (MIC > 160 ug/ml).Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: established to get the peptide for this study.GeneBank: gene sequences can be donlownedMW751544.",
