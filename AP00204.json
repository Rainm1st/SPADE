    "Literature": "Discovery: A variant of nisin A. It differs from Nisin A only by one aa at residue at position 27: N for nisin Z and H for Nisin.Chemical modification:  There are two di-dehydroalanines (Dha), S5, S33; one di-dehydrobutyrine (Dhb), T2; one lanthionine, S3-C7; and four methyllanthionines, T8-C11, T13-C19, T23-C26, and T25-C28 (provided by T. Stein).Activity: active against L. lactis MG1363 (MIC 0.02 ug/ml), L. monocytogenes LMG10470 or TT82E or LK132 (MIC 1.5-12.5 ug/ml), B. cereus CH-85 (MIC 6.25 ug/ml), S. aureus LMG10147 or LMG15975 or MRSA (MIC 6.25 ug/ml), and E. faecium LMG11423 or LMG16003 or LMG16216 (MIC 3.13 ug/ml) anti-VRE (Guo et al., 2024.Antivirus: Nisin was found to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor human ACE2 (Bhattacharya et al., 2021).In addition, Nisin ZP, a high content form (95%), can inhibit head and Neck Cancer tumorigenesis (Kamarajan et al., 2015).
