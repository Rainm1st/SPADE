  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: first identified throught bioinformatic study in silico (Moretta et al., 2020). Antimicrobial activity was demonstrated using a His-tagged recombinat form in 2023 (see ref).Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is poorly similar (37.5%) toLugensin B. R: 15%; G=D: 10%. GRAVY: -1.05; M Wt: 14659.976; M formula: C624H986N197O204S1, mol ex coeff: 10020.Activity: inhibited the growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 at 17 uM (250 ug/ml) but not other bacteria tested.Structure:  Alphafold2 predicted several beta strands. Model in the paper to be confirmed.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: IPTG-induced, His-tag form expressed in strain BL21(DE3) as insoluble fraction. It may form multimers even under reducing conditions.",
