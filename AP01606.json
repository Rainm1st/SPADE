  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: Initially thought an unusual lantibiotic. It is actually a S-linked glyco-peptide (Oman TJ et al. 2011 Nat Chem Biol 7:78-80), i.e. a class IV bacteriocin according to the original classification. Sublancin does not react with iodoacetamide demonstrating it does not contain free thiols. However, after treatment with TCEP, four out of five cysteines became accessible for alkylation.  Cys-22 glycosylation (glucose attachment) is essential for antimicrobial activity.Chemical modification:  There are two disulfide bonds (C7-C36 and C14-C29). Such bridges confer superior stability to this peptide (no degradation after storing in water at room temp for TWO years!) (see the ref).Activity: Active against S. aureus and B. subtilis.Structure:  Its 3D structure has been determined by NMR (Garcia De Gonzalo CV, et al., 2014). The two helices (residues 6-16 and 26-35) are adjacent to each other and linked via a well-defined loop.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.MOA: It was found that large mechanosensitive channel MscL determines bacterial susceptibility to sublancin 168. This mechanism differs from that for nisin or Pep5 (Kouwen et al. 2009 Antimicrob Agents Chemother 53: 4702-11).MOA:bacteria:  It appears that antibacterial activity of sublancin requires the PTS systemBiswas et al., 2021.
