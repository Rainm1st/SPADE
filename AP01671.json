    "Literature": "APD deduced this sequence based on the PCR results in the ref as well as the seq of enterocin P2 (AP00853) by assuming the N-terminal sequence is the same. APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (86.36%) toEnterocin PMol. Wt:  4715.207; GRAVY: -0.27; Mol Formula:   C204H310N55O64S3; mol ex coeff: 19755.Discovery:screened LAB strains isolated from the tilapia intestine.Activity: showed a broad spectrum of activity against indicator strains of Gram- E. coli KCTC 25922, P. mirabilis KCTC 2510, V. vulnificus, V. parahaemolyticus, V. alginolyticus, K. pneumoniae KCTC 2245, S. typhimurium KCTC 2421, P. aeruginosa KCTC 2641, P. putida, Gram+ B. subtilis KCTC 1022, B. megaterium KCTC 2000, S. aureus KCTC 1928, L. monocytogenes KCTC 3710, L. acidophilus, and S. thermophilus, including food-borne pathogens.Antimicrobial robustness: activity is susceptible to proteases; pH-susceptible: gradually decreased with increase in pH to 6 and 7.
