  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: This peptide showed woderate activity against Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, P. Aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae (MIC 20-40 uM), and good activity against S. aureus (10 uM).  This peptide stimulate insulin release in vitro using BRIN-BD11 clonal beta cells or isolated mouse islets and in vivo using mice fed a high-fat diet to produce obesity and insulin resistance (Owolabi BO et al., 2016), thereby of interest for type 2 diabetes (T2D). The [P5K] analog appeared to be more potent.  Intraperitoneal administration of the [P5K] and [D9k] analogues (75 nmol/kg body weight) to high-fat-fed mice with insulin resistance significantly enhanced glucose tolerance with a concomitant increase in insulin secretion. This peptide is also anticancer by inducing lung cancer cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase (Zhang et al., 2019). Updated 12/2018; 4/2019.",
