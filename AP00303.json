  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Chemical modification:  It contains one disulfide bond.Activity:  Active against B. subtilis (MIC 30 ug/ml), S. aureus ATCC 8530 (MIC 30 ug/ml), E. coli W 160.37 (MIC 40 ug/ml), P. putida NCIM 2102 (MIC 40 ug/ml), M. luteus MT 166 (MIC 20 ug/ml), and yeast S. cerevisiae ATCC 8530 (MIC 80 ug/ml). It also is also toxic to cancer cells, including A549 (IC50 27.4 uM), MCF-7 (IC50 29.6 uM), PC3 (IC50 49.7 uM), and HepG2 (IC50 35.7 uM) as indicated by IC50 after 48 h incubation (similar results were obtained after 6 h, 12, 24, and 48 h incubation).SAR: the peptide became inactive after disulfide bond reduction.MOA:bacteria: permeated bacterial membranes.MOA:cancer:  Tigerinin-1 triggers the expression of necroptosis pathway proteins. It generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induces oxidative stress-mediated genotoxicity. Tigerinin-1 inhibits cancer cell proliferation, reduces neovascularization, and down-regulates the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) genes.In vitro toxicity:  rat RBC (erythrocytes): The peptide is not hemo.lytic up to a concentration of 200 ug/ml.Updated 5/2020; 7/2021; 6/2022; Jan2025",
