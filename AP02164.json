    "Literature": "Activity: active against  S. aureus MetS ATCC 6538P (MIC 8 ug/ml), S. aureus MetS ATCC 19636 (MIC 16 ug/ml), S. aureus MetR L1400 (MIC 32 ug/ml), S. pyogenes SKF13400 (MIC 0.5 ug/ml), S. pneumoniae L44 (MIC 8 ug/ml), E.faecium VanS L568 (MIC 128 ug/ml), E.faecalis VanS L559 or  VanA L560 (MIC 128 ug/ml), E.coli ATCC 25922 (MIC >128 ug/ml), and C.albicans ATCC 90028 (MIC >128 ug/ml). Very active against anaerobic bacteria C. difficile L4013, L1365, or L4015 (MIC 0.25-2 ug/ml), C. butyricum L4008 (MIC 0.25 ug/ml), C. perfringens L4053 (MIC 2 ug/ml), C. perfringens L3607 (MIC 2 ug/ml), P. asaccharolyticus L521 (MIC 1 ug/ml), but not B.fragilis ATCC 25285 (MIC >128 ug/ml).Antimicrobial robustness:  serum-sensitive: 30% bovine serum reduced peptide activity against S. aureus.SAR: This peptide shares 19 residues with class II lantibiotic actagardine. In addition, it contains one extra Ala at the N-terminus and an extra Arg at the C-terminus. Hencce, it is slightly more active than actagardine against staphylococci and streptococci. C-terminal amidated NAI-802 became more active than the WT and also insensitiv to 30% serum. The modified form may be a potential lead.Ala(0)-NAI-802 is a minor congener of NAI-802 (5%). Activity not reported but predicted to be active against Gram+ as well.Updated Jan2013; 7/2021.",
