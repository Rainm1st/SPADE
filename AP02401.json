    "Literature": "~42% similar toAP1959:frog Temporin-HN1. Artificially synthesized based on the bacterial Cry11Bb protein, which is toxic to mosquito larvae. The sequence has been patented. At 7.1 uM, this synthetic peptide inhibited the growth of E. coli ATCC 25922, S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619, H. influenzae ATCC 49247,  E. faecalis ATCC 29212, P. aeruginosa ATCC27603, P. aeruginosa (Multi-Resistant), and K. pneumoniae ATCC70603 (Segura C et al., 2007).  In addition, the protease-resistant BTM-P1d (i.e., synthesized using D-amino acids), not the BTM-P1 synthesized in L-amino acids, displayed A. aegypti larval toxicity (Lemeshko VV, Orduz S., 2013). It adopts a helical conformation in 30% TFE. MOA: it appears to permeate membranes. Deposited and provided by Sergio Orduz on May 6, 2014. APD release May 8, 2014.",
