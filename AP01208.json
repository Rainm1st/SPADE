    "Literature": "Discovery: RTD-like theta-defensin derived from human pseudogenes.Activity: RC2 is most active against primary isolates of HIV-1. The molecule can self associate in water in a concentration dependent manner.Structure:  In 2007, a low-resolution structure was initially determined in the presence of SDS micelles (PDB ID: 2ATG). In 2012, a high-resolution structure was determined in water (Conibear AC et al., 2012).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.MOA:virus: It binds to gp120 and CD4, thereby inhibiting HIV entry (Wang W J Immunol 2004; 173:515-520).
