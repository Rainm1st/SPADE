  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Warning: only the N-terminal sequence was provided. APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (40%) toXLAsp-P2Discovery:screened 137 LAB strains isolated from freshwater fish intestine. Plantarum JY22 was purified from Cell free supernatant (CFS) by ethyl acetate and gel filtration.Activity: active against Gram+ B. cereus.Antimicrobial robustness: activity is heat-stable (autocalve); pH-sensitive: activity gradually decreased till pH 5.5 (74.2%) and lost at pH 6.5 or higher. Protease-susceptible (nutrase, pepsin, papain) but not alpha-amylaseMOA:bacteria: memrbane damage led to leakage.The original Phylloseptin-H10 has been merged with AP1350.",
