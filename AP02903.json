    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide shows 38.7% similarity toAscaphin-6.  Molecular formula:  C138H239N39O40S3; Mol Wt 3206.826; GRAVY= -0.85; Wimley-White whole-residue hydrophobicity of the peptide:  12.8  kcal/mol.Activity: Active against Gram- bacterium A. hydrophila (MIC 10 mg/L). BG-CATH25, obtained after deleting the N-terminal four residues, is more active (MIC 1.25). APD comment: Which is the native form remains to be established by Edman degradation of the purified peptide. Updated 7/2020",
