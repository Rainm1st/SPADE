    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide shows 50% similarity totoad Alyteserin-2Ma. GRAVY: 0.976; Mol Wt: 1876.272; mol formula: C89H146N22O22; isoelectric point: 8.8. This is a tick-generated AMP (through the catalytic activity of acidic gut endoproteinases) based on the blood sucked in to avoid infection from food source.Activity: Active against yeast C. albicans (MIC 2.1 uM), C. parapsilosis (MIC 12.5), C. tropicalis (MIC 2.1), C. neoformans (MIC 1.6), and S. cerevisiae (MIC 3.1 uM), filamentous fungi A. niger (MIC 12.5 u<), A. flavus (MIC 50), A. fumigatus (MIC 6.3 uM). Not active against the tested bacteria. It appeared to be membrane active. CD: Helical in the presence of 50% TFE or 25 mM SDS micelles. NMR studies revelaed the helical region between residues 101-112 in the presence of 200 fold SDS (100 mM).",
