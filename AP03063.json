  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "AMP significance: It is assumed that this peptide can be generated in vivo under a reduced condition. HD-5(1-9) can inhibits celluar attachment and entry of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (Boffert et al., 2020). HCMV infection causes severe illness in newborns and immunocompromised patients. This peptide may be developed into a viral inhibitor. The discovery of HD-5 active fragments indicate the complex of host defense peptides and potential role in regulating the microbiome.Database analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 36.4% similarity toCn-AMP3.Activity: Highly Active against various commensal bacteria B. subtilis 168trpC; B breve, B. lonqum, B. adolescentis Ni3,29c, B. vulqatus, E. coli MC1000, L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus, L. salivarius, and S. solivarius salivarius. In addition, it is active against A. baumannii 4-MRGN (MIC 25 uM), K.pneumoniae 3-MRGN (inactive), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 50 uM), E. faecium 475747 (MIC 12.5 uM), and S. aureus USA300 (MIC 50 uM).
