    "Literature": "Activity:  Active against B. megaterium Bm11 (LC= lethal conc.1.2 uM), S. aureus Cowan 1 (LC 2.3 uM), Y. pseudotubercolosis (LC 2.0 uM), S. pyogenes beta hem. group A (MIC 1-2.3 uM), E. coli D21 (LC 11.9 uM), A.hydrophila Bo-3N (LC >360 uM), P.aeruginosa ATCC15692 (LC >360 uM), and C. albicans (LC 3.4 uM); also S. aureus (MIC ~3-8 uM), E. coli (MIC 6.2-100 uM), and A. baumannii (MIC 24 uM), including parasites L. donovani and L. mexicana (Molecules. 2015 Feb 6;20(2):2775-85; J Biol Chem. 2005 Jan 14;280(2):984-90). Also active against C. jeikeium ATCC BAA-949 (MIC 8 uM) (Bruno Casciaro et al., 2020).  It is also active against channel catfish virus (CCV) as well as the non-enveloped frog virus 3 (FV3) (Chinchar VG et al. Virol. 323:268-275). It also showed anticancer effect on lung cancer cells (Swithenbank  et al., 2020).Structure: C-terminal amidated. For NMR studies in SDS and DPC micelles, see Carotenuto et al. 2008 (J Med Chem 51: 2354-62).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure bound to LPSherein the PDB.Transgenic plants: The small, naturally occurring antimicrobial cationic peptide, temporin A, was N-terminally modified (MsrA3) and expressed in potato plants. MsrA3 conveyed strong resistance to late blight and pink rot phytopathogens in addition to the bacterial pathogen Erwinia carotovora. Transgenic tubers remained disease-free during storage for more than 2 years (Transgenic Res. 2004 Apr;13(2):181-90). It also showed wound healing effect (Simonetti O et al., 2008).
