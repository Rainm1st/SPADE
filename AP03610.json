    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (84.2%) toTemporin-1TGaL: 31%; F: 23%; G: 15%. GRAVY: 1.62; Mol Wt:  1450.815; Mol formula:C75H114N14O15; mol ex coeff: 0.Discovery: isolated from frog skin secretions.Activity: active against E.coli ATCC 35218 (MIC >250 uM) and S. aureus ATCC 12600 (MIC 15.6 uM).In vitro toxicity: female murine RBC: HC50 8 uM, highly hemolytic.SAR: a natural form without amidation was also isolated. This form is inactive against all the bacteria tested, confirming the importance of C-terminal amidation for this temporin activity. Proportionally, this form is also less toxic. Est. 3/2023",
