    "Literature": "Activity: Highly active against A. salmonicida 99-1 (MIC 2 uM),  A. salmonicida 97-4 (MIC 2 uM),  S. enterica serovar Typhimurium MS7953s or 14028s or I or II (MIC 2-17.7 uM), P. aeruginosa K799 or Z61 (MIC 4-8 uM), E. coli CGSC4908 or UB1005 or DC2 (MIC 2-4 uM), S. epidermidis C621 (MIC 8 uM), methicillin-resistant S. aureus C623 or MRSA (MIC 8 uM), C. albicans C627 (MIC 8 uM). Also, active against E. coli (MIC 2.2-3.3 uM), A. salmonicida (MIC 2-35 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 4-8 uM); C. aquatilis (MIC 2.2-4.4 uM), P. haemolytica (MIC 4.4-8.8 uM), Gram-positive B. subtilis (MIC 1.1-2.2 uM), S. aureus (MIC 17.7-35 uM), S. epidermidis (MIC 8 uM), and C. albicans. In addition, it is active against oral bacteria S. mutans (UA 159, UA 140) (MIC 8-16 ug/ml), S. sanguinis ATCC 10556; S. sobrinus ATCC 6715, S. gordonii ATCC 10558, L. casei ATCC 393, L. fermenti (MIC 2-32 ug/ml) (Tao R et al., 2011). Also, this peptide kills the biofilms of S. mutans UA159 (~50% killed at 32 ug/ml based on SYT09 and PI staining).Structure: Structure in TFE or DPC was reported by Syvitski RT et al 2005 Biochemistry 44: 7282-93.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-insensitive:E. coli (625 mM).SAR:  Truncation of either end (i.e. decrease in hydrophobicity) reduces the activity of the peptide (Cho J et al., 2012). Amidated variant: The sequence of NRC-4 (Patrzykat et al. 2003 ANTIMICROB AGENTS CHEMOTHER, 47: 2464â€“2470) is identical to this peptide. However, NRC-4 is C-terminally amidated and is active against A. salmonicida 99-1,  A. salmonicida 97-4,  S. enterica serovar Typhimurium MS7953s (MIC 2 uM), S. enterica serovar Typhimurium 14028s (MIC 16 uM), P. aeruginosa K799 (MIC 8 uM), P. aeruginosa Z61 (MIC 4 uM), E. coli CGSC4908 (MIC 2 uM), E. coli UB1005 (MIC 4 uM), E. coli DC2 (MIC 2 uM), S. epidermidis C621, MRSA C623, C. albicans C627 (MIC 8 uM). This peptide is chemotactic as well (Pundir P et al 2013). This amidated form also inhibits cancer cells J5, Huh7, and Hep3BHsu et al., 2022. The amidated peptide showed higher antimicrobial activity than the non-amidated formHsu et al., 2022. For other NRC peptides, see AP777-792. Updated 6/2013; 7/2013; 5/2015; 3/2019; 7/2021",
