Coeff:  4845; GARVY: -0.48; Wimley-White whole-residue hydrophobicity: 0.62 kcal/mol.Activity: Like plectasin, An1a also showed inhibitory activity against dengue virus-2 (DENV2, ~10 uM 50% inhibition) and Zika virus (ZIKV, ~2 uM 50% inhibition) in Vero cells.MOA: Also like plectasin and its fusion protein, An1a significantly inhibits the NS2Bâ€“NS3 protease (Ki = 9.47 uM for DENV2 and 12.54 uM for ZIKV), which is essential for flavivirus replication.Toxicity: hemo-lytic: no hemolysis of hRBC below 20 uM.  \nReg7/2021",
