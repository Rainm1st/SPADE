Mol Wt: 4390.29; Mol Extinction coeff 10395; mol formula: C190H300N59O46S7. Active against L. monocytogenes (MIC 1 uM), L. fleischmannii  (MIC 15 uM), L. grayi  (MIC 8 uM) and L. seeligeri  (MIC 15 uM), S. aureus  (MIC 15 uM), and Gram- P. aeruginosa  (MIC 15 uM). In addition, it completely inhibited the germination of  fungi F. culmorum (IC50 4 uM) and F. graminearum (IC50 4 uM).",
