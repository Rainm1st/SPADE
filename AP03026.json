  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 55% similarity toTachyplesin I.Activity: Active against E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 1 ug/ml), K. pneumoniae ATCC13883 (MIC 2 ug/ml), A. baumannii ATCC19606 (MIC 0.5 ug/ml), and P. aeruginosa ATCC27853 (MIC 2 ug/ml).Animal model:mouse: the peptide showed in vivo efficacy against E. coli when i.v. or i.p. injected.  A significant (p<0.001) reduction of more the 3 logo CFU/ml compared to vehicle treatment was observed for NZ17074 in blood and peritoneal fluid at 5 hours after treatment.Structure: refined by NMR: 100% in most favored Ramachandran region (Elliott et al., 2020).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Updated 7/2021; 12/2021; 5/2024",
