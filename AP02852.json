    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide shows 75.5% similarity tosugarcane defensin 1.  Molecular formula:  C227H369N73O69S9; Mol Wt 5552.454; GRAVY=  -0.63; Wimley-White whole-residue hydrophobicity of the peptide:  12.95  kcal/mol.Activity: Active against X. oryzae pv. oryzae, X. oryzae pv. oryzicola (causing  a serious blight of rice) (MIC 3.9 ug/mL), E. carotovora (MIC 63 ug/mL), fungi   H. oryzae (MIC 15 ug/mL). Also active against human C. albicans but not human bacteria. Upon Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae infection in the leaves, both OsDEFs are highly upregulated at 8 days post-infection and located in the extracellular compartment, suggesting a role in host defense (Weerawanich et al., 2018). In addition, OsAFP1 functions by chelating cadmium in the cytosol and facilitating its secretion into extracellular spaces, lowering the cytosolic cadmium concentration and concomitantly driving long-distance cadmium transport through xylem vessels.Structure: Crystal structure was determined by molecular replacement in 2020.Residues Arg1, His2, Leu4, Arg9, and Phe10 play critical roles in OsAFP1 dimer formation.You can rotate, zoom, and view the structureherein the PDB.MOA:  OsAFP1 exerts antifungal activity by binding to PI(3)P contained in the C. albicans cell membrane, thereby applying cellular stress and inducing apoptosis (Ochiai et al., 2020). PIPs are phosphatidylinositols. Updated 2/2018; 3/2020.",
