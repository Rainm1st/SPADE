    "Literature": "Chemical modification: C-terminal amidated. The D-form was found to be more active and stable than the L-form (D>L; Herin OH et al 2000 Antimicrob Agents Chemother 44:68-72).Activity: cell viability evaluated by MTT. Active against B. megaterium Bm11 (LC50 1.3 uM), S. aureus Cowan I (LC50 6.2 uM ), Y. pseudotubercolosis, S. pyogenes beta hem. group A (MIC 2.8-7 uM), E. coli D21 (LC50 21 uM), P.aeruginosa ATCC15692 (MIC >360 uM), and C. albicans (MIC 4 uM),  including parasites L. donovani promastigotes (LC50 8.6 uM) and L. mexicana (MIC 24-64 uM) (Molecules. 2015 Feb 6;20(2):2775-85; J Biol Chem. 2005 Jan 14;280(2):984-90).  Also E. coli (MIC 12.5-50 uM), S. aureus (12-48 uM), and A. baumannii (MIC 24 uM). This peptide has antibiofilm ability against S. epidermidis (Maisetta et al., 2016). Also active against C. jeikeium ATCC BAA-949 (MIC 8 uM) (Bruno Casciaro et al., 2020).  Temporin B also inhibits herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection (Marcocci ME et al., 2018). It can damage viral envelope and inflences  the attachment, the entry of the virus into the host cell as well as the following post infection phase.Antimicrobial robustness: serum-insensitive: Remarkably, antibacterial activity was retained in the presence of 33% human serum.Toxicity: 50% hemo.lysis concentration >120 uM.Chemotactic: the peptide can promote cell migration (Di Grazia A et al., 2014).Structure:You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.MOA:  Temporin B can permeabilize the plasma membrane of both bacteria and parasite Leishmania.
