    "Literature": "Peptide design:  this peptide was obtained by combining BAMP-27 residues 9-20 (KFKKLFKKLSPV) and OP-145 N-terminal fragment corresponding to residues 13-29 of human LL-37 (IGKEFKRIVERIKRFLR).Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide shows 62% similarity toCaLL.Activity: Active against S. aureus ATCC 29213 (MIC 20 uM), E. faecalis ATCC 19433 (MIC 15 uM), S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC 10 uM), MRSA (MIC 5-10 uM), E. faecium VRE (MIC 5 uM), and Gram- E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 10 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 20 uM), A. baumannii ATCC 19606 (MIC 10 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883 (MIC 2.5 uM). Antibiofilms: S. aureus (MBEC 20 uM) and P. aeruginosa (MBEC 25 uM).Toxicity: Poor hemolysis at 100 uM (2%) (hemo.lytic) and 50% toxic concentrations HEK293 and Vero IC50 61-64 uM. Updated 7/2021",
