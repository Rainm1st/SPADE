  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide shows 85% similarity toDLP4.  GRAVY: 0.1375; Mol Wt: 4277.088; Mol formula: C177H290N61O48S7; mol ex coeff.: 5925.\nMost similar to AP2904.  Initially reported in 2015 (see Ref).Activity: DLP2 is now expressed, purified and proved to have antimicrobial activity against S. aureus (MRSA) byLi Z et al. 2017. Not active: Gram- bacteria: E.coli CVCC1515 (MIC >128 ug/ml; ~30 uM), E.coli CICC21530 (serotype O157:H7) (MIC> 128 ug/ml), S.typhimurium ATCC14028 (MIC >128 ug/ml), S.enteritidis CMCC50336 (MIC >128 ug/ml).  In addition, animal model:mouse: DLP2 can protect mice from MRSA infection at 3-7.5 mg/kg. Seq updated 7/2021",
