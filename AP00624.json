  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: One gene, multiple cathelicidin peptides (e.g., LL-37 and ALL-38).Sequence analysis: Compared to LL-37, ALL-38 contains one additional residue (Ala) at the N-terminus. ALL-38 is produced in female vagina under an acidic condition by cleaving the precursor protein hCAP-18 from male semen, presumably providing a sterilized environment for the new life (see the APD entry 00005 for a similar compd in insects).Activity: The antimicrobial activities of LL-37 and ALL-38 are similar against bacterial strains (E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and B. megaterium).Structure:  The APD predicts that the 3D structure and mechanism of action of ALL-38 are very similar, if not identical, to human LL-37 (see APD entry 310).",
