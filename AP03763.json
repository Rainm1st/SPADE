    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals sequence alpha showed a low level of similarity (38.46%) toChrysophsin-1R: 25%. I=V=M=A=N: 10%. The amino acid sequence of chain beta: KKKRGFWYHVGDAVTSFGRGFASAFG (net charge +6, Pho: 38%; 26 amino acids).Activity: Agar well diffusion assay: the two chains were tested at various ratios and 1:1 was found to be most active (beta chain more active). Active against indicator strains S. agalactiae 10465, L. monocytogenes 1.10753 (MIC 2.36 uM), enterotoxigenic E. coli K88, and vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis V583.Structure: became helical in 50% TFE. Alpha chain is much more helical than beta chain.MOA:bacteria: permeated membranes.",
