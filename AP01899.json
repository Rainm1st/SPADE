    "Literature": "Activity: Active against E. coli HP101BA 7601c (MIC 24.2 ug/ml), S. dysgalactiae PTCC 1074 (MIC 33.2 ug/ml), S. agalactiae PTCC 1365 (MIC 24.7 ug/ml), S. aureus PTCC 1431 (MIC 35.2 ug/ml), and K. pneumoniae PTCC 1388 (MIC 31.2 ug/ml).SAR: Synthetic C-terminally amidated peptide is active against S. aureus (MIC 7.76 ug/ml), but not active against E.coli (MIC 317 ug/ml) and A.baumannii (MIC 158 ug/ml).Toxicity: The peptide showed a dose-deppendnet effect on bllod cells and about 1.1% hemolysis at 60 ug/ml.Chemical modification: Although not reported, the peptide is likely amidated at the C-terminus.Structure: Synthetic C-terminally amidated peptide is helical in the presence of 50% or 100% TFE or POPG (Lopes et al., 2022).
