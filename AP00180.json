    "Literature": "AMP significance and sleep: Shorter sleep time relates to lower human defensin 5 secretion and compositional disturbance of the intestinal microbiota accompanied by decreased short-chain fatty acid production (Shimizu et al., 2023).Host expression and human disease: Constitutively expressed. A reduced expression is observed in ileal Crohn's disease (Wehkamp J et al., 2005). It is also constitutively expressed in human unitary tract and can be induced in kidney upon infection and detectable in urine (Spencer et al., 2012).Activity: Killed C. difficile. Human HD5 blocks papillomavirus infection (both cutaneous and mucosal papillomavirus types). HD-5 was particularly active against sexually transmitted HPV types (Buck et al., 2006). HD-5 is active against pseudotyped viruses expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins (Xu et al., 2021).It also results in decreased bacterial presence, enhanced wound healing, and hair growth from tissues devoid of adnexal structures (Lough D, et al., 2013).It also neutralizes Clostridioides difficile Toxins TcdA, TcdB, and CDT (Korbmacher et al. 2020).Structure:  (nmr+x): Three disulfide bridges. For the crystal structure, you can rotate, zoom, and view itherein the PDB. For the NMR structure, you can rotate, zoom, and view itherein the PDB.MOA:bacteria: The L- and D-forms of HD-5 are equally active against E. coli (D=L) but not S. aureus (Wei G et al 2009 JBC 284: 29180-92). It can bind LPS (Moser et al., 2014).MOA:virus: It inhibits non-enveloped BK virus infection by aggregating virions and blocking binding to host cells (JBC 2008; 283: 31125-31132). Importantly. human HD5 inhibits 2019-nCoV spike binding to ACE2 based on an unreviewed report (Wang et al., 2020).Recombinant production:yeast:Pichia pastoris: a high level expression and purification system has been reported in Pichia pastoris (Wang et al., 2009).SAR: HD-5-myr is a C-terminal lipidated form of HD-5. It is created to eanble the formation of micellar form of HD-5 dubbed nanobiotics (Lei et al., 2018).  HD-5-myr has also been referred to as ND-C14 (Guo et al., 2024).Updated 2/2014; 10/2015; 9/2017; 3/2020; 4/2020; 8/2021; Jan2023; 3/2023; 10/2023; Jan2024",
