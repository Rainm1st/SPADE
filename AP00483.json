    "Literature": "Activity: Active against fungal A. niger, A. versicolor, F. moniliforme, F. solani, N. crassa (IC50 0.04-21 ug/ml), C. albicans.Chemical modification:  It contains four disulfide bonds.Structure:  1 alpha helix from 17 to 27 (J Mol Biol 2002 Jan 25;315(4):749-57).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. It can regulate interkinetic nuclear migration in retinal neuroblasts (Lobo et al. 2007 Biochemostry 46: 987).MOA:bacteria: It accumulates in nucleus and interacts with cell cycle control protein cyclin F as the target (Lobo et al., 2007).  By screening C. albicans mutant libraries we identified that the High-Osmolarity Glycerol (HOG) pathway has a unique role in protection against NaD1 that induces reactive oxygen species that damage cells. Thus, inhibition of the HOG pathway holds promise as a broad strategy for increasing efficacy of antimicrobial peptides against C. albicans (Hayes BM, et al. 2013). Updated 5/2013.",
