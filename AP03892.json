    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is poorly similar (87.5%) toparent TetraF2W. W: 50%.Chemical modification:  C-terminal amidation.Activity: Active against E. coli K12 (MIC12.5-25 uM), S. epidermidis 1457 (MIC 12.5 uM), B. subtilis 168 (MIC 6.2 uM), and S. aureus USA300 (MIC 3.1 uM; MBC 12.5 uM). Also active against C. albicans (MIC 12.5 uM), C. glabrata (MIC 12.5 uM), and C. tropicalis (MIC 3.1-6.2 uM).Antimicrobial robustness: pH-insensitive (6.8-8); NaCl-insensitive:S. aureus (150 mM), serum-sensitive (5%).Toxicity:  human RBC HC50 30 uM.",
