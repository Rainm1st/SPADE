  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is 54.55% similar toPexigananK: 42%, F=G: 17%.Chemical modification: C-terminal amidation.Activity: active against S.aureus ATCC 25923 or ATCC 33591 MRSA (MIC 512 ug/ml or greater), S. epidermidis  ATCC 35984 (MIC 32-64 ug/ml), and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 4-8 ug/ml).SAR: A series of 12-mer scanning sequence truncation was conducted based on MSI-78. All the truncated 12mers lost activity against Gram+ MRSA (MIC 128->512 ug/ml) due to reduced hydrophobicity. Only CEM1 retained good activity against P. aeruginosa.In vitro toxicity: CEM1 is not hemo.lytic even at 512 ug/ml.Structure:  RANDOM COIL IN buffer and helical in DMPG vesicles.",
