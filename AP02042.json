  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Like EcAMP1, this peptide is active against P. infestans, a protist (not fungus) using potato tuber disks method.SAR: A C-terminal 5-residue truncated form (EcAMP2.1) was also isolated. EcAMP2.1 is also active, indicating that the last 5 residues are less important. Not active against any bacteria tested.Updated 7/2021; 10/2022.",
