    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (35%) toCathelicidin-DMActivity: Active against E. acervulina sporozoites.Antimicrobial robustness: this antiparasitic activity is slightly reduced in the presence of 100 to 300 mM NaCl (~35% to 55% viability) and clearly compromised in the presence of Ca2+ (70 to 100% viability from 1 to 3 mM) (Salt-sensitive). However, up to 10% FBS had no effect on the antimicrobial effects (serum-insensitive)Immune modulation: cNK-2 induces the expression of multiple chemokines CCL4, CCL5 and interleukin(IL)-1beta in chicken macrophage cell line HD11 cells and CCL4 and CCL5 in primary monocytes. Also, cNK-2 suppresses the LPS-induced inflammatory response by abrogating IL-1beta expression (Kim et al., 2017).Therapeutic strategy: Chicken NK-2 is expressed via B. subtilis and orally delivered for treatment.Animal model:chicken: Oral Delivery of Bacillus subtilis Expressing Chicken NK-2 Peptide Protects Against Eimeria acervulina Infection in Broiler Chickens (Wickramasuriya et al., 2021), leading to improved growth performance, enhanced gut integrity, and reduced fecal oocyst shedding.  Another paper documented the enhancement of the efficacy of Eimeria elongation factor-1alpha vaccination against Eimeria maxima infection in broiler chickens when co-administered with cNK-2 (Lee et al., 2022).  In addition, NK treatment restored dysbiosis incurred by E. acervulina infection and showed the general protective effects of orally delivered Bacillus subtilis-cNK-2 on coccidiosis infection (Wickramasuriya et al., 2023;Wickramasuriya et al., 2024).Updated 12/2017; 6/2021; 9/2022; 5/2023; 8/2024",
