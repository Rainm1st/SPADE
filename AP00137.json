    "Literature": "Discovery: purified from acid extracts of intact mouse jejunum and ileum by a combination of CM-Sepharose chromatography and sequential C-18 reverse-phase HPLC.Activity: Active against E. coli, S. typhimurium, and L. monocytogenes. ALso killed E. coli (99.9% killing at 41.9 ug/ml) and S. aureus (99.9% killing at 11.9 ug/ml) based on virtual colony count assays. This method exposed bacteria to peptides for 2 h in 10 mM phospahtate buffer before incubating in media for 12 h (Wang et al., 2023).Structure: 3 Disulfid bridges: 6, 34; 8, 23; 13, 33.SAR: linearizing the peptide by substituting C with A led to increased activity against E. coli. However, disulfide bonds appear to be important for activity against S. aureus.Updated 4/2017. Seq validated 2/2023.",
