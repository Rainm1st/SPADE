    "Literature": "Activity: At 10 ug/ml, it killed 100% E. coli and 47% S. aureus. Importantly, this CD8+ T cells derived chemokine inhibits a broad spectrum of HIV isolates.MOA:HIV: this inhibition occurs at the early stage of infection and blocks viral attachment and subsequent entry by direct interaction with the gp120 envelope glycoprotein.Structure:You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure of the all-beta dimerherein the PDB. However, this metamorphic protein can adopt two conformations (classic and alternative) and only the alternative, all-beta conformation (dimer) is HIV-active, while the monomer (consisting of 3 strans and one helix) activates the receptor XCR1 for chemotactic effects. The all-beta dimer variant of XCL1 binds to proteoglycans (glycosaminoglycans, GAGs) (provided byDr. Brian F. Volkman). Residues W55, K42, and R43 are essential for anti-HIV activity. In addition, R18, R35, and K46 are also important for HIV inhibition. Remarkably, most of these positively charged side chains are clustered on the active protein surface, but disociated in the classic chemokine fold, thereby providing a structural basis for HIV inhibition and anti-HIV drug design(Guzzo C et al. 2015).Protein engineering: Interestingly, introducing a disulfide bond between A36C and A49C mutants locks the chemokine conformation to the all-beta dimeric form (dubbed CC5), which is indeed a potent HIV inhibitor with high affinity to heparin(Fox JC et al., 2015).
