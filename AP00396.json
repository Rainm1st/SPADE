    "Literature": "Activity:  Active against B. megoturium (LC 0.3 uM),  Strep. pyogmes (LC 1-3 uM), A. calccouceticus (LC 1-3 uM), and B. subtilis (LC 15 uM).  lethal conc=LC. Also: Active against Gram- bacteria B-cereus ATCC 10876 (MIC >32 ug/ml) (PMID:30641213).  Also:  active against Gram- S. typhimurium (MIC 10 uM), E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 5 uM), A. Baumannii (MIC 2.5 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 or PAO1 (MIC 2.5-5.0 uM), Gram+ bacteria S-aureus MRSA (MIC >40 uM),  B. Globigii (MIC 5 uM), and L. Monocytogenes (MIC 10 uM)  (Pashaie et al., 2025).MOA:bacteria:  it probably binds to DNA (Boman HG et al. 1993 Infect Immun 61: 2978-84).  In vitro, PR-39 retarded DNA migration in the 0.8% agarose gel (Baumann A et al., 2014).Resistance development:yes:bacteria:S. maltophilia:  MIC changed from 7.5 ug/ml to >60 ug/ml after 25 passages.Resistance mechanism: altered are multiple genes encoding enzymes, transporters, transcriptional regulators, and other functions (Blanco et al., 2020).Recombinant production:yeast:Pichia pastoris: it showed 3-fold more expression (1.0-1.2 mg/l) in the calmodulin fusion system than in the XynCDBFV fusion carrier system. The fusion protein was active against E. coli.Updated 8/2014; 8/2017; Jan2019, 7/2021; 12/2023; 12/2024; 4/2025",
