    "Literature": "It inhibited HIV-1 infection in cultured human T-lymphoblast (CEM-SS) cells (EC50 40 nM) and cytotoxicity (TC50 1760 nM), therapeutic index (44)(Ireland et al., 2008). Cycloviolacins Y4 and Y5 are more hydrophobic (>50%) than cycloviolacin Y1 (33%, entry 1077), thereby more hemolytic. Updated 7/2021",
