  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 57% similarity toPR-39. molecular formula: C188H300N62O34; Mol Wt: 3972.858; GRAVY = -1.11. Active against E. coli BW25113 (MIC 1.2 uM). Peptide truncation indicates that the antimicrobial activity is mainly located at the N-terminal region residues 1-16 (MIC 4 uM).  While the intact molecule shows similar activity against sbmA and yjiL KO strains, the truncated peptides 1-16, 8-24, and 16-32 are inactive, indicating the entire sequence do not depend on the Pro-rich peptide transporters for activity.Activity: Tur1A inhibits E. coli.MOA:bacteria: It inhibits protein translation by binding to the exit tunnel of ribosome in a reversed order. Residues 1-16 plays a major role in ribosome binding.Complex structure: the peptide in complex with ribosome.You can rotate, zoom, and view the lipid II bound 3D structureherein the PDB.Updated 3/2018; 7/2021; 12/2024.",
