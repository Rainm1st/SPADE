    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide most resembles (44.4% similarity)Baceridin. Originally identified as a sex pheromone (Nakayama J et al., 1995, Isolation and Structure of the Enterococcus faecalis Sex Pheromone, cOB1, That Induces Conjugal Transfer of the Hemolysin/Bacteriocin Plasmids, pOB1 and pYI1 (plasmid-encoded), Japan Society of Biosci. Biotech. and Agrochem, Tokyo, pp. 703-705),Activity: cOB1 of Commensal E. faecalis can restrict the growth of multidrug-resistant E. faecalis V583 (MIC 22 pg/mL) in the gut at an extremely low concentration. It can form amyloid-like structures (Gour et al., 2019).MOA:bacteria: The killing mechanism is under investigation but apparently differs from the classic AMPs that target membranes.AMP significance: This study indicates the importance of maintaining the commensal population as a means of preventing infection.Update 4/2016; 12/2024.",
