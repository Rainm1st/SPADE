  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Peptide design: obtained by replacing F17 and F27 of FK13 with W. In addition, Q22 and D26 (as in LL-37) are substited by R, leading to an Arg-rich peptide.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (69.23%) toFK-13.  R: 38%; I=W: 15%. GRAVY: -0.65; M Wt: 1885.341; M formula: C90H147N31O14, mol ex coeff: 11100.Activity: Active against E. coli KCTC 1682 (MIC 4 uM), P. aeruginosa KCTC 1637 (MIC 8 uM), S. typhimurium KCTC 1926 (MIC 2 uM), Gram+ B. subtilis KCTC 3068 (MIC 4 uM), S. epidermidis KCTC 1917 (MIC 4 uM), and  S. aureus KCTC1621 (MIC 2 uM). Non-standard assay: activity was measured in 1% peptone where LL-37 (control) is active against S. aureus.Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-insensitive:E. coli (150 mM); KCl-insensitive:E. coli (4.5 mM); NH4Cl-insensitive:E. coli (6 uM); MgCl2-insensitive:E. coli (1 mM); CaCl2-insensitive:E. coli (2.5 mM); FeCl3-insensitive:E. coli (4 uM); serum-insensitive:E. coli (20%).Toxicity: human RBC: HC50 > 256 uM, not hemo.lytic. MIC determination contains 1% peptone. AllStructure: helical in 50% TFE.Anti-inflammatory: suppressed NO 100%, and TNF-alpha 60.4% (cf. LL-37: 100% and 90.4%, respectively).",
