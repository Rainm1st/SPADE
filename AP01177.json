    "Literature": "The sequence of the chain b (PlnF) of this two-chain bacteriocin is VFHAYSARGVRNNYKSAVGPADWVISAVRGIHG. The peptide pair (1:1 ratio) is at least 1000 times more active than the individual peptide. Active against P. pentosaceus Pac 1.0 (MIC 5 nM), L.  plantarum 965 (MIC 7 nM), L. casei subsp. casei NCDO 161 (MIC 20 nM), L. casei NCDO 2713 (MIC 150 nM), L. sake NCDO 2714 (MIC 4 nM), L. viridescens NCDO 1655 (MIC 2 nM), P. pentosaceus NCDO 990 (MIC 30 nM), L. sake 706 (MIC 100 nM), P. acidilactici CH (MIC 10 nM), and L. curvatus 89 (MIC 5 nM). A recombinat form is active against S. aureus and S. citreus (Tang et al. 2017). Updated 3/2016; 4/2017; 10/2017.",
