    "Literature": "Clinical relevance: Anemia could reduce  the level of hBD-3, leading to tool caries (PMID34521396).Activity: An inducible human AMP. Active against E. coli DSM1103 (MIC 9.4 ug/ml), K. pneumoniae DSM681 (MIC 25 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa DSM1128 (MIC 18.75 ug/ml), S. aureus ATCC25923 or MRSA (MIC 4.7 ug/ml), and S. pneumoniae DSM11865 (MIC 4.7 ug/ml) (ref see AP1315).Viruses: HIV-1 (Bharucha et al., 2021); West Nile Virus (WNV) (Chessa et al., 2022);Fungi: ??. It also has the wound healing effect (Hirsch T et al., 2009).Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-insensitive:E.coli (150 mM); MgCl2-sensitive:E.coli (2.5 mM).Synergy:AMPs:  It showed synergistic effect with LL-37 in killing S. aureus(Abou Aliwa et al., 2014). More active against a mutant strain from the mprF regulating system (Li et al., 2007).SAR:  It is a dimer in solution, which may be responsible for high antibacterial activity. Cf. HBD1 and HBD2 are monomers in solution (Schibli DJ et al. 2002 J Biol Chem 277: 8279).  Delete the double arginines RR at the C-terminus of hBD-3 or shifting them to the N-terminus reduced peptide activity against S. aureus by 5 fold (Sakagami-Yasui Y et al., 2017). In addition to antibacterial effects, hBD-2 and hBD-3 induce chemotaxis via interactions with CCR2 or CCR6 expressing cells (Rohr J et al. 2010 J Immunol 184:6688-94). The S-S bridges are needed for chemotactic but not antibacterial activity.Structure: It contains three disulfide bonds and  a short helical segment preceding a three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet. S-S bond pattern: Cys1–Cys5, Cys2–Cys4, and Cys3–Cys6.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.MOA:bacteria: This peptide inhibits cell wall biosynthesis in Staphylococci (Sass V et al 2010 Infect Immu 78: 2793-800).MOA:virus: Its anti-HIV-1 effect may be due to a direct interaction with virions and through modulation of the CXCR4 co-ceceptor (Weinberg et al 2006 Adv Dent Res 19: 42-8).MOA:fungi:C. auris: it causes fungal apoptosis.Resistance mechanism:   In HEK293 cells, Mycobacterium tuberculosis uses dehydrogenating L-alanine to suppress this AMP expression (Peng et al., 2024).Updated Jan2011; 12/2013.2/2015; 6/2017; 9/2017; 7/2021; 5/2024",
