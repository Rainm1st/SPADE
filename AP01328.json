    "Literature": "Activity: Antiviral activity against foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) in vitro (EC50 0.6 ug/ml).Toxicity: BHK-21 cells (TC50 19.5 ug/ml), TI 31.4) (PMID: 30012343). It also showed antiviral activity against non-enveloped, spherical  virus (betanodavirus) (Wang Y et al. 2010 Peptides 31: 1026-33).Animal model:zebrafish:  It showed efficacy in the zebrafish (Pan CY et al 2011). Animal model:mouse: it prtects mice from sepsis (PMID: 28882626). It shows in vivo efficacy against H. pylori infection (PMID: 25996410). Epi-1 can reduce MRSA bacterial counts in the wounded region, promote wound healing, and increase angiogenesis at the injury site. Epi-1 treatment decreaseds the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-6, and MCP-1 in the serum (i.e., anti-inflammatory), and regulated the recruitment of monocytes and clearance of lymphocytes around the wounded region during healing(Huang HN et al., 2013).Animal model:mouse: it has therapeutic potential against T. vaginalis infection (PMID: 30552913). Epinecidin-1 has in vitro antitumor activity to the HT1080 cell line, and functions like lytic peptides (PMID: 19007829). It induces apoptosis in human leukemia U937 cells (PMID: 19720101).Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: fused with thioredoxin, acid cleavage of DP site. Ac-Var-1, with one additional P at the N-terminus, inhibited E. coli and S. aureus (Jeyarajan et al., 2024).Updated 9/20/11; sequence 10/7/2013; 11/2017; ref 8/2019; 10/2021; Jan2024",
