    "Literature": "Discovery: in silico mine the venom gland transcriptome library by comparing with known spider genomes for similar AMPs.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (37.5%) toLtTx-1ak: 15%; c: 12%. GRAVY: -0.538; mol Wt: 7306.515; mol formula: C314H503N93O91S8; mol ex coeff: 1990.Chemical modification:  four disulfide bonds are predicted: C1–C4, C2–C5, C3–C8, C6–C7.Activity: strongly active against E. coli (MIC 1 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 1 uM), B. cereus (MIC 1 uM), and S. aureus (MIC 8 uM). As strong as melittin.It also suppressed LPS-induced inflammation by down-regulating TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6MOA:bacteria: it permeabilized and polarized the membranes of multiple bacteria.  ROS production.Toxicity: bovine RBC: 10% hemolysis at 20 uM peptide. LDH release: up to 20 uM, it did not show toxicity to human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADMSCs) and murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells.",
