    "Literature": "Activity: Active against G+ bacteria B. subtilis, C. glutamicum, M. lysodeikticus, M. luteus, G- bacteria  E. coli mc 1061, P. aeruginosa, P. stutzeri, S. flexneri, V. alginolyticus, V. harveyi, and V. parahaemolyticus (mostly MIC <6.2 uM). Also, it showed antiviral activity against an important aquaculture pathogen, white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), in crustaceans.A synthetic peptide (26 residues) corresponding to the LPS-binding domain was found to be more potent than the recombinant protein corresponding to the entire polypeptide. Also reported by (Imjongjirak C et al, 2007) and the LPS-binding domain was found to be antimicrobial. Updated 11/2014.",
