  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Host expression:induced: treatment with a bacterial pathogen Aeromonas hydrophila induced the expression of Ma-Hep transcripts in loach midgut, head kidney, and gill.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (88.46%) tofish SA-hepcidin1C: 32%;  R: 12%; GRAVY: -0.156; M Wt: 2937.604; M formula: C117H187N39O31S9; mol ex coeff: 1990.Activity: active against E. coli (MIC 6 ug/ml), S. aureus (MIC 6 ug/ml), A. hydrophila (MIC 6 ug/ml), V. anguillarum (MIC 6 ug/ml), P. fluorescens (MIC 6 ug/ml), and beta-H. streptococcus (MIC 6 ug/ml). The universal low MIC values result from a non-standard assay by using a poor broth medium (1 % tryptone, 0.5 % NaCl).MOA:bacteria: kill bacteria by destroying bacterial cell membranes.Recombinant production:yeast:Pichia pastoris: it has been expressed.Microbiota regulation: Feed supplemented with Ma-sHep expressing yeast improved the intestinal flora of loach by increasing the dominant bacteria and decreasing the harmful bacteria.",
