    "Literature": "Five RumC genes were found and three pepties were detected. Two with MIC data. APD analysis reveals that the unmodified sequence of RumC5 shows 37% similarity toPa-AMP1.Activity: Active against C. perfringens CpA or S40, B. cereus TZ 415, and L. monocytogenes EGDE (imhibition halo size 1-3 mm).",
