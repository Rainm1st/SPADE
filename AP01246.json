    "Literature": "Discovery: Ortholog to hBD-3. Also found byHinrichsen K, et al., 2008.Host expression:induced:  This peptide is inducible by bacteria. Interestingly, mBD-14 can induce regulatory T cells (Tregs) that tame T cell-driven reactions so that it could perform antimicrobial defense without collateral damage by the adamptive immune system (Navid F et al. 2011 online Dec. 14).  mBD-3 appears to play a role in mucosal immunity in the lower urinary tract (Becknell B et al. 2014). IL-17A and IL-17F are essential for the production of mBD-14 to clear S. aureus nasal colonization (Archer NK et al., 2016).Activity: Active against Gram-positive bacteria S. aureus ATCC 12600, S. aureus ATCC 33593, S. epidermidis ATCC 14990, S. pyogenes ATCC 12344, E. faecalis ATCC 29212, E faecalis ATCC 51299 (anti-VRE) (MBC 1.2-2.4 uM), Gram-negative bacteria E. coli ATCC 11775, E. coli ATCC 25922, E. coli ESBL 4 (clinical isolate), S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 13311 (MBC 0.6-1.2 uM),  P. aeruginosa ATCC 10145, P. aeruginosa Va 6201/2000 (multiresistant; clinical isolate), and yeast C. albicans ATCC 24433 (MBC 1.2 uM).Like hBD-3, this peptide also displays chemotactic effects to cells expressing CCR2 or CCR6 receptors. Activation of this path could promote cell growth, including tumor cellsRöhrl J, et al., 2012.It has anticancer effect on lung cancer cells (Hanaoka Y et al., 2016;Phan et al., 2016).Antimicrobial robustness: The activity of this peptide is also salt-sensitive and pH-sensitive.Surface immobilized peptide: the mouse beta-defensin-14 (MBD-14) was immobilized on the polyetheretherketone (PEEK) surface with three-dimensional (3D) porous structure to improve its antibacterial activity and osseointegration (Yuan et al., 2019).Updated Dec 20, 2011; 12/1/2013; 4/2014; 10/2016; 9/2017; Jan2019; Jan2024; 11/2024.",
