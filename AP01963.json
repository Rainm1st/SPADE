  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "It has a unique sequence which shows 32.7% toplant hevin-like WANP-1a. The bacteriocin was produced after 12 hours in the lag phase and the use of Diaion HP-20 hydrophobic resin increased yield. Partial sequence was determined and the entire sequence was deduced. This peptide is thermal stable, pH tolerant, and resistant to proteases. Reducing agent DTT had no effect on peptide activity or migration on gel.Activity: Active against B. subtilis (MIC ~2 uM), S. aureus (MIC ~2 uM), E. coli (MIC ~7 uM), V. cholerae, P. aeruginosa (MIC ~15 uM), and L. monocytogenes (MIC ~22 uM). The 3D structure is determined by crystallographic method at 2 ASingh PK et al., 2015. It consists of 4 beta-strands forming a twisted sheet. The peptide has a disulfide bond pattern similar to beta defensins and a structural scaffold like alpha-defensins.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.
