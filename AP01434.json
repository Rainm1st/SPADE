  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Activity of the natural form was not evaluated due to a low amount of the peptide. A synthetic peptide was found to be active. The L and D-forms of the peptide showed identical antibacterial activity (D=L) against E. coli (MIC 25 uM), B. subtilis (MIC 6.25 uM), and S. aureus USA300 MRSA (MIC 3.1 uM) (Mishra B and Wang G 2012 JACS).Structure: 3D structure to be published (G Wang).SAR:  a mutant was found to be HIV active (EC50=0.63 uM) (Wang G et al. 2010 Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 54: 1343-1346).Animal model:mouse: The same mutant also displayed in vivo efficacy in preventing biofilm formation in an animal model:mouse (Menousek J et al 2012).
