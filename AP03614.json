  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: genome mining and sequence alignment. Antimicrobial substance was extracted from cell free fermented broth using diaion HP20 resin and subsequently purified by HPLC.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (41.38%) toThuricin 4A-4C=S: 21%; V=T: 13%. GRAVY: 0.66; M Wt: 2601.967; Mol formula:  C106H167N26O39S5; molar extinction coeff: 5550.Chemical modification: not yet fully established.Activity: killed S. aureus MTCC 1430 (MIC 0.8 ug/ml), E. coli MTCC 1610 (MIC 1.2 ug/ml), and C. albicans MTCC 183 (MIC 30-45 ug/ml) in 30 min at 4 ug/ml, 6 ug/ml and 20 ug/ml, respectively. It inhibited ~99% viral growth of SARS-Cov-2 at 10 ug/ml.Antimicrobial robustness: activity is retained between pH 4-10. Heat-stable at 100oC. But autoclave can disrupt the activity!MOA: damaged cell envelope (SEM). ATP release was detected.Toxicity: highly hemolytic (HC50 6 ug/ml). HEK 293T (LC50 25-50 ug/ml) and vero cells (LC50 25 ug/ml).",
