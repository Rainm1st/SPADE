    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is highly similar (90%) toHill-Cec12previously reported from the same insect.Activity: Peptide H3 is active against E. coli ATCC25922 and 15 clinical MDR strains (MIC 0.8 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC700603 (MIC 3.1 uM), A.baumannii ATCC19606 (MIC 6.2 uM), P-aeruginosa CMCC10104(MIC >25 uM), V. parahaemolyticus ATCC17802 (MIC 1.6 uM), E-faecalis ATCC29212 (MIC >25 uM), B. subtilis BNCC109047 (MIC 1.6 uM), S-epidermidis ATCC35984 (MIC >25 uM), S-aureus ATCC6538 (MIC >25 uM), and C-albicans ATCC10231 (MIC > 25 uM).Antimicrobial robustness:  NaCl-insensitive:E. coli (150 mM); CaCl2-insensitive:E. coli (2 mM);  KCl-insensitive:E. coli (4.5 mM); serum-insensitive:E. coli (10% fetal bovine serum).Toxicity: little hemo.lytic at 128 ug/ml. Not toxic to human liver cells at 128 ug/ml.MOA:bacteria: H3 permeabilized E. coli membranes.",
