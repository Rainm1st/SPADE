  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: active against Gram+ bacteria WT S. aureus ATCC29213 (MIC 3.7 uM).Sequence analysis: Siamycin I differs by only one amino acid from siamycin II; it has a valine residue at position 4.Chemical modification:  In both peptides, disulfide bonds link Cys1 with Cys13 and Cys7 with Cys19, and the side chain of Asp9 forms an amide bond with the N-terminus. MS-271 undergoes extraordinary folding, i.e. the \"tail' (Phe10-dTrp21) passes through the \"ring' region (Cys1-Asp9) (\"lasso' structure) (Katahira R et al. 1996 Bioorg Med Chem 4:121).Structure:  NMR study in DMSO. The primary structure of MS-271 was identical to that of siamycin I (Bioorg Med Chem. 1996).MOA:bacteria: it targets Lipid II at the Gram-Positive Cell Surface. Siamycin-I Acts at the Cell Division Septum and Leads to PBP2 Delocalization.Resistance development:yes:bacteria:S. aureus: bacteria develop resistance by making mutations in the essential WalKR two-component system that causes thickening of the cell wall (Tan et al., 2019).Updated 2/2024",
