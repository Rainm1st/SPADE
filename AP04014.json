  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (83.33%) toMyxinidin H3KR: 25%; G=I: 17%.Activity: active against E. coli ATCC 11219 (MIC 4 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 13388 (MIC 10 uM), S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028 (MIC 10 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC 10031 (MIC 10 uM), S. aureus ATCC 6538 (MIC 5 uM).SAR: N-ternimal acetylation had small effect on peptide activity.Toxicity: human RBC (5%), 8% hemolysis at 200 uM (HC50> 200 uM, low hemo.lytic).Structure: helical in 50% TFE. NMR studies revealed possible dimer and residues 2-6 are helical.",
