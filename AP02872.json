    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide shows 57.2% similarity toAndersonin-X1. Derived from the N-terminal segment ofesculentin 1a.Structure: Helix in a membrane-mimetic environment.You can rotate, zoom, and view the structureherein the PDB.Activity: Active against fungus S. cerevisiae. Subsequent studies: active against S. agalactiae and P. aeruginosa/biofilms.  Also active against C. jeikeium ATCC BAA-949 (MIC 0.125 uM) (Bruno Casciaro et al., 2020).Chemotactic to Human HaCaT Keratinocytes in an EGF Receptor-Dependent Manner (Di Grazia et al., 2015). Esculentin-1a(1-21).NH2, esculentin-1b(1-18).NH2, and esculentin-1a(1-14).NH2 produced concentration-dependent stimulations of insulin release from BRIN-BD11 rat clonal beta-cells, 1.1B4 human-derived pancreatic beta-cells (Musale et al., 2018).Synergy:antibiotic: It showed synergy with antibiotics Aztreonam.Surface immobilized peptide: It has been covalently coupled to contact lens (Casciaro et al., 2017).Updated 7/2020; 7/2021",
