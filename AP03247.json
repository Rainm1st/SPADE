    "Literature": "Host expression: AmAMP1 is expressed at late stages of coral development in ectodermal cells.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (36.5%) toHuman drosomycin-like defensin.Activity: PT07 (folded similar to homologous peptides) is active against E. coli K12 MG1665 (MIC 11.7 uM), B. megaterium ATCC 14581 (MIC 0.1 uM), S. aureus ATCC 12600 (MIC 47 uM), CNJ778_B. megaterium-like (MIC 0.05-0.1 uM), Acinetobacter spec. (MIC 1.5-2.9 uM), and V.corallilyticus (MIC >94 uM).Antimicrobial robustness: For this form, MIC values are similar at pH 6.8 and pH 8.0 (pH-insensitive).UniProt: for additional info and predicted structure.Updated 7/2021; 4/2024; 10/2024",
