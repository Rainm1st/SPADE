  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Active against S. aureus (MIC 7.5 uM), E. coli (0.94 uM), A. baumannii (1.875 uM), P-aeruginosa (MIC >15 uM), B. subtilis (MIC 0.47 uM), and K. pneumoniae (MIC 3.75 uM). The comparison of ponericins with those well-studied peptides suggests that ponericins may adopt an amphipathic alpha-helical structure on cell membranes. Helical conforamtion was observed by CD for multiple variants of L1. L1V and L1F variants displayed higher membrane permeation than L1. L1 and its single residue variants showed less than 2% hemolysis till 15 uM, indicative of a lack of toxicity at the tested concentration. Provided by Gregory A. Caputo. Updated 7/2021",
