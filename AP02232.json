    "Literature": "Calculated mass 5543.746 and chemical formula C247H455N81O63. ALa=27% and Lys=41%. Wimley-White whole-residue hydrophobicity of the peptide is 29.97 kcal/mol. Database analysis revealed its similarity to Oncorhyncin II  (AP411), which is also rich in Ala and Lys. cgMolluscidin is active against B. subtilis KCTC1021, M. luteus ATCC9340, E. coli D31, S. enterica KCTC2514,  human pathogen V. parahaemolyticus KCCM41664 (MEC 0.1-0.5 uM), and S. aureus RM4220 (MEC 5.6 uM). MEC (minimaal effective concentration) to inhibit the bacterial growth in radial diffusion asssay by diluting the peptide every 2 fold as in the microdilution assay. Updated 6/2019; 7/2021",
