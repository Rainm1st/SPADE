    "Literature": "Activity: Active against S. aureus SG511-Berlin (MIC 0.0095ug/ml) and S. aureus MRSA252. (MIC 0.2ug/ml).Chemical modification: The sequence is subject to posttranslationally modifications. There are  three di-dehydrobutyrine (Dhb), T1,T16, and T20; Dhb1 is unstable and deaminates to 2-oxo-butyryl; two lanthionines, S9-C13 and S26-C33; and one methyllanthionine, T24-C27 (kindly provided by T. Stein).MOA:bacteria: Pep5 exerts its action by forming voltage-dependent pores in the cytoplasmic membranes. It also causes autolysis of staphylococci.SAR: A mutation of K18 to Pro caused a drop in activity by a factor of 500 compared to the WT (see ref for entry 1616). UPdated 4/2019; 10/2023",
