    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (62.5%) toEsculentin-2 HYba1GRAVY: 1.1; Mol formula: C103H164N29O25; 23% G, 14% I, V, and H. M. Wt: 2220.61, and Mol ex coeff.: 5550. predicted to be helical.Activity: All tested bacteria and yeast were resistant to synthetic So-pis at the tested concentrations. However, it showed activity against  C. irritans trophonts and theronts (killed 20% at 12 uM in 60 min, 83% at 24 uM in 30 min, and 100% at 48 uM or 96 uM in 15 min). MOA: cell lysis and cause leak.Toxicity: less than 10% hemolysis of red drum erythrocytes at 48 uM. Reg. 11/2021",
