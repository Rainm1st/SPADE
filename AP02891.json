    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide shows 47% similarity tofrog Frenatin 1.  Molecular formula:   C73H130N20O25; Mol Wt 1726.955; GRAVY= 0.22; Wimley-White whole-residue hydrophobicity of the peptide: 1.04 kcal/mol.Activity: Active against E. coli (MIC 64 uM) and S. aureus (32 uM). The peptide is 22.7% Helical in the presence of 50% TFE. A missing R in the sequence was added thanks to the email of William Farias Porto. 7/2018.",
