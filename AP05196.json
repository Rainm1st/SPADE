    "Literature": "Host expression:induced: induced by injecting Enterobacter cloacae to Diapausing pupae for peptide purification.Discovery: hemolymph collected, salt precipitation, ion-exchange chromatogrphic purification.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar to (61.04%) toGloverin BmGlv4G: 18%, D: 10%. pI: 8.5; GRAVY: -0.657; M Wt: 13785.093; mol formula: C605H930N171O190S1; mol ex coeff: 18140. Appeared to be the first glovin reported.Activity: active against E. coli K12 (MIC 1-3 uM) and Gram+ B.megaterium (MIC>100 uM).Structure: random in 10 mM PBS but helical in 20% hexafluoro-isopropanol.Peptide stability: heat-stable: activity not lost at 100oC for 10 min.Antimicrobial robustness: MgCl2-sensitive:E. coli (40 mM), inhibited peptide activity. LPS binding inhibited peptide activity.MOA:bacteria: inhibited the synthesis of outer membrane proteinss Omp F, Omp C, and Omp A.",
