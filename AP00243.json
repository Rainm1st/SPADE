    "Literature": "Activity against M. luteus (MIC 0.4ug/ml), L. lactis (MIC 12ug/ml), P.multocida, S. epidermis (MIC 25ug/ml), B. cereus, E. coli (MIC 50ug/ml), L. innocua, S. aureus and S. uberis (MIC 100ug/ml). By similarity to Caerin 1.1, it contains two amphipathic helices separated by a region of less-defined helicity and greater flexibility. This peptide could inhibit HIV infection (VanCompernolle et al., 2015). Updated 6/2015.GW. 4/2019 CW",
