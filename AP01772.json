    "Literature": "The two Sm-AMP-D peptides differ only at one residue (N vs. D). It is uncertain whether the D form resulted from deamidation during purification.Activity: Since it was not possible to separate the two peptides, their antifungal activity was tested together. Active against B. sorokiniana (IC50 0.5 uM), F. oxysporum (IC50 0.35 uM), F. graminearum (IC50 0.52 uM), F. graminearum (IC50 0.52 uM), B. cinerea (IC50 1.0 uM), Ph. betae (IC50 0.52 uM), and P. debaryanum (IC50 0.5 uM).
