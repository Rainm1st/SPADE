Bactericidal activity (MLC): B. subtilis ATCC 6633 (MLC 0.25 uM) and E. coli WT-2 (MLC 0.25 uM). Minimal lethal concentrations (MLC) of peptide are given in uM and are the concentration of substance required necessary to kill ~ 99% of the bacteria.Antimicrobial robustness:  Salt-insensitive: maintain activity up to 340 mM NaCl.Toxicity:  highly hemolytic (HC50 ~1 uM).Structure:  CD: helical in the presence of 50% TFE. It contains an unusual C-terminal RRRH sequence. Updated Jan2017; 11/2018; 7/2021 GW",
