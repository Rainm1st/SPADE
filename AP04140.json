  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (85.19%) toCM-AMP1obtained by removing two N-terminal residues to the C-terminus.Activity: active against E. coli ATCC 25922 (50% activity of 100 ug/ml ampicillin). Non-standard assay.Activity: oxidized and reduced forms showed similar activity, but alkylation caused a loss of most of the activty at 10 ug/ml.",
