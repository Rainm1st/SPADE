    "Literature": "Discovery: This isolated AMP corresponds to residues 116-148 of the channel catfish hemoglobin-beta protein.Host expression: The expression of the peptide is upregulated in skin and gill in response to ich (Ichthyophthirius multifiliis) infection. Ich is a major parasite of catfish.Activity: This AMP showed moderate activity against Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli D31 (MIC 3.4 uM), A. hydrophila (MIC 3.4 uM) and V. alginolyticus 88-5009-A2 (MIC 13.5 uM), but no activity against Gram-positive bacteria such as S.aureus, S.faecalis, S.iniae, Gram- P.aeruginosa, S. flexneri (MIC > 200 ug/ml). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined here as the lowest concentration that reduced bacterial growth by more than 50%. Also active against parasite Ich trophont (PCmin 1.7 uM), T. pyriformis (PCmin 6.8 uM), similar to piscidin 1.  Here the minimum protozoacidal concentration = PCmin. Updated 7/2021",
