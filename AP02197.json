    "Literature": "The founding member of the peptides called peptaibols, which are collected in a specialized database (see the APD link). Warning: this peptide contains seven nonstandard amino acids.Activity:Mainly active against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi.MOA: Native alamethicin channels ( a barrel-stave model) exhibit rather low degrees of ion selectivity: they pass both anions and cations, and even extremely bulky cations are permeable to some extent (Woolley GA 2007).Chemical modification: alpha-aminoisobutyric acid at positions 2, 4, 7, 9, 12, 15, and 16 (represented using Alanines here). The side chain of residue E17 forms an amide bond with proline-1 (Payne JW, Jakes R, Hartley BS. Biochem J. 1970 May;117(4):757-66).Structure: A helical structure was determined (Pub-Med).You can rotate, zoom, and view the trimeric crystal structureherein the PDB.SAR: Substitution of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid by alanine can reduce peptide activity (Jen WC et al. J Appl Bacteriol. 1987 Oct;63(4):293-8). A cyclic structure is not a necessary condition for a peptide to induce voltage-dependent conductances in membranes and that the open form possesses all the structural elements required for such an activity (Gis BF et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1977 Jan;74(1):115-9). For a more complete story, readLeitgeb B et al. Chem Biodivers. 2007 Jun;4(6):1027-51. Updated 6/3/13; 2/2014; 4/2016; 6/2019; 2/2023.",
