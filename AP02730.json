  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE shows poor sequence similarity (84%) toScorpion Opistoporin 2.Activity: Active against B. subtilis NCIMB 8024 (MIC 4 ug/ml), S. epidermidis sp., S. aureus SH100 (MIC 32-64 ug/ml), E. coli JM109, K. pneumoniae NCTC 13439, and  C. albicans (MIC 64-128 ug/ml).Structure: The peptide can adopt a helical conformation in 60% TFE, laying a basis for memrbane targeting.SAR: Residues 1-14 retains antibacterial activity against both Gram+ and Gram- bacteria, indicating the importance of the N-terminal region  (Luo et al., 2021).Toxicity:  it showed toxicity to mammalian cells. The peptide appears to activate a cascade of events leading to cell death via inducing caspase-1 dependent pyroptosis (Elrayess et al., 2022).MOA:cancer: it damaged Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer A549 Cells via Inducing Membranolysis and Mitochondrial Dysfunction (Deng et al., 2023).
