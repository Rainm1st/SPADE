    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (62.5%) toMagainin-M1.Activity: Initially found inactive against limited lab bacteria in 2010 (see the ref). A subsequent analysis in 2014 using more bacteria revealed selective activity against certain strains, including C. albicans NCTC 3179 (MIC 100 uM), Gram+ S. mutans ATCC 10449 (MIC 50 uM), Gram- F. nucleatum NCTC 10562 (MIC 12.5 uM). These are mostly oral bacteria. It also binds LPS  (McLean et al., 2014).",
