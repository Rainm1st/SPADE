    "Literature": "Discovery: Antimicrobial activity was observed as early as 1895 and the protein components crystallized in 1941. However, these  effects are due to a mixture of purothionins till 1972. In this 1974 study, antibacterial activity of both mixture and separated alpha and beta-thionins were evaluated. Amino acid sequence was reported in 1976 (Can J Biochem).Activity: the peptide showed activity against pathogens of plant origin. Crude (CP) active against S. uvarum CC-21 (MIC 32  ug/ml) inoculum 1000, S. uvarum CC-23 (MIC <4 ug/ml) inoculum 100000,and 2 ug/ml inoculum 1000, S. cerevisiae (MIC 8 ug/ml) inoculum 1000 and (MIC 32 ug/ml) inoculum 100000.  Also active against fungi A. brassicola (IC50 3 ug/ml), A. pisi (IC50 3 ug/ml), B. cinerea (IC50 12 ug/ml), C. lindemuthianum (IC50 15 ug/ml), F. culmorum (IC50 1 ug/ml), F. oxysporum (IC50 0.5 ug/ml), N. haematococca (IC50 1 ug/ml), P. betae (IC50 4 ug/ml), P. tritici-repentis (IC50 4 ug/ml),  V. dahliae (IC50 0.5 ug/ml), V. inaequalis (IC50 5 ug/ml), bacteria B. megaterium (IC50 1 ug/ml), E.carotovora (IC50 >500 ug/ml), E.coli (IC50 250 ug/ml), and S. lutea (IC50 5 ug/ml).Structure: Crystal structure was reported in 1995 (see the PDB link).You can rotate, zoom, and view the tetrameric crystal structureherein the PDB.MOA: It probably works by forming ion channels in membranes (JBC2000).Updated 2/2014; Ref 3/2015; 8/2015; 7/2021; 11/2023.",
