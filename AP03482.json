GRAVY: 0.986; mol wt: 2120.683; Mol formula:  C99H182N26O24; Mol ex Coeff: 0.Activity: Active against S. aureus ATCC 33591 or USA300 (MRSA, MIC 32 ug/ml), E.faecalis JH2-2 (MIC 128 ug/ml), L.monocytogenes (MIC 512 ug/ml), K.pneumoniae (MIC 512 ug/ml or higher), A. baumannii sensitive (MIC 32-64 ug/ml),  A.baumannii IMI, MER, OXA-23, OXA-50 (MIC 64-128 ug/ml), E.coli (MIC 512 ug/ml), S.typhimurium, B.cereus (MIC 256 ug/ml),  P.aeruginosa PAO1 (MIC >512 ug/ml), P.aeruginosa AMT0060 (CF) (MIC 256 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa C3719 or LES400 (MIC 64 ug/ml).MOA:bacteria: the peptide appeared to work on membranes. There was membrane permeabilization as well.Resistance development:no:bacteria:S. aureus USA300: MRSA USA300 did not develop resistance to the peptide after 20 passages.Toxicity: HC50 50% hemo.lytic concentration is 458 ug/ml. Lung fibroblast (i.e. IMR-90) cells, IC50 = 294 ug/ml;  Lung epithelial (i.e. BEAS-2B) and liver (i.e. HepG2) cells: IC50 >1000 ug/ml.Anti-inflmmatory: the peptide neutralizes LPS and LTA, reducing the inflammation caused by such bacterial components.Animal model:wax moth: The peptides were effective in vivo within a Galleria mellonella model of MRSA USA300 infection.",
