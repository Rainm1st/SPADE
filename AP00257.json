  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Activity against M. luteus (MIC 12 ug/ml) and E. coli (MIC 25 ug/ml). Also, this peptide could inhibit HIV infection at a concentration that is also toxic to T cells (J Virol 2005; 79:11598-11606).Structure: NMR analysis revealed two helical regions (residues 4-10 and 17-21) in a TFE/water solution (Chia B et al. 2000 Australian J Chem 53:257-265). The discontinuity of the helix was proposed due to the existence of 2 glycines in the central region.  Updated 12/2011; 2/2014; 4/2019; 7/2021.",
