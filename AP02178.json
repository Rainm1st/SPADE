    "Literature": "Activity: Active against Gram-negative E. coli O157:H7, S. typhimurium, K. pneumoniae and Gram-positive S. aureus (MRSA), and L. monocytogenes (MIC 2-8 uM).Antimicrobial robustness: Salt-insensitive with and without 100 mM NaCl.SAR: The antibacterial activity of the peptide is maintained after disruption of disulfide bonds. The odd number of Cys residues (5) plays an important role in determining the molecular form as well as activity of this defensin. Different from other defensins, the five cysteines form 5 pairs of intermolecular disulfide bonds, leading to a homodimer (Ji S et al., 2018).Structure:  determined by NMR.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.
