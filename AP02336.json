    "Literature": "Chemical modification: K2 is Orn. The carboxylic group of the C-terminal V forms an ester bond with the side chain of Y3 OH. Also Fengycin B2 was found byRoy et al. 2013and it is exactly the same as Fengycin.Activity: Active against fungi C. Albicans (MIC 15.62 ug/ml), A. niger (MIC 15.62 ug/ml), S.epidermidis (MIC 1000 ug/ml), and E.coli (MIC 1000 ug/ml). Self-assembled peptide in organic solvents appeared to be more active.Found in multiple species. Updated 7/2021",
