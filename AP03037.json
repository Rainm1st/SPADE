  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 98.4% similarity toSPINK9-v1GRAVY: -0.80; Mol Wt:  7192.365; Mol formula: C317H485N87O88S8, Mol ex coeff: 4845.Activity: Active only against various E. coli in 1% TSB (no TSB, no activity), but not P.aeruginosa NCTC 11440 and ATCC 10145, S.aureus ATCC 6538, S.pyogenes ATCC 12344 or the yeast strain C.albicans ATCC 24433 (data not shown).MOA:  Seventeen kilodalton protein (SKP), a chaperone in the periplasmic space of Gram-negative bacteria, is identified as an interacting partner. A SKP KO E. coli strain is more sensitive to killing. The killing activity also depended on the sequence essential for KLK5 inhibition. The original Pv-Def was replaced due to a lack of antimicorbial activity; 7/2021",
