  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Chemical modification: Warning: this peptide contains non-natural amino acids although they are represented using the closest standard 20 amino acids. Specifically, T1, T8, and T17 are dehydrated into Dhb, while Ser12 is dehydrated to Dha. In total, four S/T residues are dehydrated. Residue K20 is Dab (2,4-diaminobutyric acid). Finally, the acyl chain CH3-(CH2)7-CH(OH)-CH2-CO (a C10 fatty acid chain) is attached to the N-terminus. Thus, the entire sequence is CH3-(CH2)7-CH(OH)-CH2-CO-Dhb-Pro-Ala-Ala-Ala-Val-Val-Dhb-Thr-Val-Ile-Dha-Gly-Ala-Ala-Val-Dhb-Thr-Ala-Dab-Ser-Ile. 77.3% similar to Sclerosin (AP02052), also from a Pseudomonas strain.Activity: Active against (bacteriostatic) Gram- X. campestris pv. campestris NCCB92058 (MIC 16 ug/ml), X. translucens pv. graminis LMG587 (MIC 4 ug/ml), P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (MIC 8 ug/ml), bactericidal to Gram+ S. aureus subsp. aureus 5334R4, B. cereus ATCC14579 (MIC 8 ug/ml), and M. flavus (not pathogenic) (MIC 2 ug/ml). Inactive: R.syzygii subsp. Syzygii LMG6969, E-coli ET8, K-pneumoniae LMG20218, and A-baumannii LMG01041 (no inhibition at 32 uM). Medipeptin B is predicted to be antimicrobial since it differs from Medipeptin A only at two positions (T9 to G and G13 to A). Reg 10/2021",
