    "Literature": "See also Cecropin A (AP00139).Activity: Active against insect pathogens S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa, X. nematophilus, E. coli K12, B. megaterium, B. subtilis (inhibition zone assays). Microdilution: E. coli BUE55 or NCTC11954 (MIC 1.7-3.3 uM), B. fragilis NCTC943 (MIC 1.7 uM), P. aeruginosa NCTC10332 (MIC 16.7 uM), S. epidermidis NCTC 11047 (MIC 33.3 uM) (Moore et al., 1996). Also Active against Gram- L. anguillarum (MIC 0.6 uM), E. coli (MIC 0.5 uM), Gram+ C. glutamicum (MIC 1.0 uM), and S. aureus (MIC 9.4 uM). Warning: the C-terminus of the peptide made in this study is slightly shorter than the original sequence here.Antimicrobial robustness:  heat-stable after 30 min treatment at 100oC, but can be cleaved by proteases.Toxicity: 50% hemolysis at 40 uM (see ref for AP1571).Surface immobilized peptide: A 35mer of this sequence (no c-terminal two residues) has been immobilized (Xu D et al., 2013).Updated 7/2021; 11/2023; 5/2024; 8/2024; 4/2025.",
