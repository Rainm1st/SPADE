  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Named by APD as no name given in the paper. The peptide-producing strain inhibited H. parasuis growth. Synthetic AMP inhibited H. parasuis at 10 ug/ml (MIC). Kinetics: The growth of H. parasuis was inhibited by the peptide at 20 ug/ml after 20 min.Antimicrobial robustness: The purified substance was resistant up to 80 Â°C and pH ranging 3-7, but lost activity when treated with proteases pronase E and proteinase K at 10mg/ml.
