  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "A drosomycin homologous to insect drosomycin has now been found in humans. Like insect drosomycin, DLD is specifically active against Aspergillus spp. and other clinically relevant filamentous fungi, including A. fumigatus (MIC 6.25 uM), A. nidulans (MIC 6.25 uM), A. ustus (MIC 12.5 uM), F. solani (MIC 25 uM),  F. oxysporum (MIC 6.25 uM), and R. oryzae (MIC 6.25 uM). It is not active against tested Gram-positive (S.aureus, Streptococcus groupA, E.faecalis, MIC >50 uM), Gram-negative (E. coli, K.pneumoniae, S.serovar Enteritidis, P.aeruginosa), and yeast strains (C.albicans, C.glabrata, C.tropicalis, C.krusei, and C.neoformans, MIC >50 uM).
