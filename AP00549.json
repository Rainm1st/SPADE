    "Literature": "Discovery: It is the first fungal defensin identified in the secretome of the ascomycete P. nigrella.Chemical modification:  three disulfide bonds: C4-C30, C15-C37, and C19-C39.Activity:  Active against Gram+ bacteria S. pneumoniae PSSP 109 strains (MIC 0.25-8 ug/ml), S. pneumoniae PRSP 24 strains (MIC 0.125-4 ug/ml), S. pyogenes ESSP 12 strains (MIC 0.063-0.5 ug/ml), S. aureus MSSA 5 strains (MIC 4-32 ug/ml), S. aureus MRSA 4 strains (MIC 16-32 ug/ml) and 1 strain (MIC >128 ug/ml), S. epidermidis MSSE (MIC 8-32 ug/ml), S. epidermidis MRSE (MIC 4-16 uM), E. faecalis 6 strains (MIC 64->128 ug/ml), E. faecium 5 strains VSEF or 3 strains VREF (MIC 16-64 uM, or 2 strains >128),  C. diphtheriae 4 strains (MIC 2-8 ug/ml), C. jeikeium 3 strains (MIC 1-2 ug/ml), B. thuringiensis 3 strains (MIC 32-64 ug/ml). Misc. strains, see the ref.In vitro toxicity: Plectasin showed no cytotoxicity to A549 cells, normal human bronchial epithelial cells, or lung fibroblasts, and it did not induce IL-8 transcription or production in A549 cells. The results suggest that plectasin could be an inoffensive alternative antibiotic for clinical application (BBRC 2008 Oct 3;374(4):709-13).Structure: high-resolution crystal structure (PDB entries: 3E7U for the L-form and 3E7R for the racemic form) has also been determined (Madel K et al. 2009 Protein Sci. 18: 1146-54) using racemic crystallography, and the peptide adopts the same fold as originally found in solution by NMR. NMR=XYou can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.MOA:bacteria: The D-form is INACTIVE (L>D), indicative of a non-membrane target. Plectasin targets the bacterial cell wall precursor lipid II (Schneider et al. 2010 Science 328: 1168-72).Recombinant production:yeast:Pichia pastoris: The yeast transformant 4Ple-61 harboring four-copy cassette of plectasin secreted 183.2 mg/L total protein (60.8% plectasin) at the flask level within 120 h, 2.3 times higher than that of the one-copy expression cassette (Liang et al., 2022). Also Recombinant production:bacteria:Bacillus subtilis, fused with SUMO (41 mg/L):yield: 5.5 mg/L; active against S. pneumoniae, etc.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli:a thioredoxin fusion (Jing et al., 2010).In vitro PK:serum:human: Half-life in vitro:serum:mouse: remained active after 24 h incubation in 90% serum.In vivo PK:mice:IP: in vivo PK:mice:IV or in vivo PK:mice:SC: half life abount 50 min.In vivo toxicity:mice:IV: MTD = 125 mg/kg.Animal model:mouse: S. pneumoniae infected peritonitis model:IP: IV treated at 10 mg/kg 1 h postinfection (i.p./i.v.): bacterial CFU reduced 1 log after 2 h and 3 log after 5 h. Likewise, infected and SC treated 1 h later at 10 mg/kg, protected mice from death during 7 days.A mouse pneumonia model (i.n./i.v.): infected day 1, treated day2 at 10 mg/kg, and euthanized at day 3: cfu reduction by 3-4 logs in lung, efficacy comparable to penicillin.It was regarded as a potential lead.Updated 11/12/2010; 10/2014; 7/2021; 12/2022; 11/2024; 12/2024",
