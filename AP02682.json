    "Literature": "Chemical modification:  Chain A (shown) is connected with chain B (DIGKYCGYAHALN, amidated) via a disulfide bond. Trp is bromated at position 6 (6-bromotryptophan).Sequence analysis:APD analysis reveals that the sequence of chain A shows 45% similarity toCentrocin 2.Activity: the heavy chain is responsible for antibacterial activity as the light chain (B) was inactive (MIC > 100 uM). Active against planktonic C. glutamicum (MIC 0.78 uM), S. aureus (MIC 0.78 uM), E. coli #1 (MIC 0.1 uM), and P. aeruginosa (MIC 0.78 uM). Updated 7/2021; 11/2023",
