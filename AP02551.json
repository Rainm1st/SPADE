    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence  is 69.2% similar toscorpion Hp1036. Active against  B. megaterium AB 90008; M. luteus AB2010179 (MIC 41-82 uM);  E. coli DH5alpha (MIC 82 uM). Spiniferin-M, a peptide variant with E4K and D11N to increase the net charge by 3, showed stronger activity, especially against M. luteus (MIC 2 uM).  Provided by Xiuqing Wang.",
