  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (93.1%) toCathelicidin-PYK:21%; L:14%; R: 10%.Peptide engineering: the orginal disulfide bond between C3 and C7 has been replaced with a amide bond between the sidechains of D3 and X7 (2,4-diaminobutyric acid. Warning: represented with K in this sequence).Activity: active against E. coli ATCC 25922 (1 uM), P. aeruginosa SVB-B9 (MIC 8 uM) in MHB, S-aureus ATCC 29213 (MIC>64 uM), and C-albicans SC5314T (MIC >64 uM).Antimicrobial robustness: salt-sensitive; active against E. coli ATCC 25922 (4 uM), P. aeruginosa SVB-B9 (MIC 32 uM) in cation-adjusted MHB media.Structure: more helical than WT. Most helical in TFE in the series!",
