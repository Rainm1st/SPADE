  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Active against Gram-positive S. aureus CCT 6538, S. saprophyticus, B. subtilis CCT 2471, B. thuringiensis (MIC all at 40 uM), Gram-negative E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 80 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883 (80 uM), and A. faecalis ATCC 8750 (MIC 40 uM), and yeast C. albicans (40 uM).  It only showed weak leishmanicidal activity IC50=72 uM (cf. amidated 11 uM). The peptide has an inhibitory effect on MCF-7 breast cancer cells at 12.5 uM (Torres et al., 2018).Toxicity:  mouse erythrocytes: not hemo.lytic (HC50 0.1-1 mM).Structure: Helical in TFE, SDS micelles, or PC/PG (70/30) vesicles, but not in PC vesicles.
