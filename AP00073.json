    "Literature": "Activity: inhibition zone assay (lethal concentration LC: minimal concnetration for inhibition, MIC-like): Active against E. coli D21 (LC 1.8 uM),  B. megaterium BmII, S. aureus Cowan 1 (LC 0.4-0.6 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC15692  (LC 30.6 uM), C. albicans, and S. cerevisiae (LC 3.8-4.7 uM). In addition, this peptide promotes insulin secretion in acute 20-min incubations with glucose responsive BRIN-BD11 cells (Marenah L et al., 2006), thereby of interest for type 2 diabetes (T2D).Toxicity: It is highly hemolytic at 0.5 uM.Structure: The C-terminal S-S-linked loop resembles the lipid A binding hexapeptide ring domain of polymyxin B. Found in multiple species.  Updated 10/2015; 12/2018; 7/2021",
