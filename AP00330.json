  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Chemical modification:  This peptide is extensively modified: W2 is a 6-bromotryptophan (XXH); R4 is a dihydroxyarginine; K5, K8, K12, and K17 are dihydroxylysines; K19 and K23 are 5-hydroxylysines; and Y15, Y16, Y20 and Y21 are 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (XXK). Such modifications led to heterogeneity as well as enhanced antimicrobial activity (Taylor SW et al. 2000 J Bio Chem 275: 38417-38426).Activity: active against S. aureus or MRSA, P. aeruginosa.Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-insensitive:P. aeruginosa (200 mM) and pH-insensitive:P. aeruginosa (5.5 to 7.4). Chemical modifications are important for pH/salt tolerance of antimicrobial activity.Toxicity: human RBC (HC50 <10 ug/ml) is more sensitive to these peptides than sheep RBC (HC50 40 ug/ml).Structure:  it is helical in 50% TFE.",
