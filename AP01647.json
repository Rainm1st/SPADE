    "Literature": "Extensive post-translation is predicted but not characterized yet. The peptide displays antibacterial activity towards closely related gram-positive bacteria. A cluster of twelve genes that covers ~10 kb is essential for the production, modification, export, and self immunity of this natural product. The amino-terminus of PZN has been modified to N(alpha),N(alpha)-dimethylarginine. The peptide has highly selective antibiotic activity against B. anthracisACS Chem Biol 2011by targeting membranes (Molohon KJ et al., 2016). Found in multiple species.
