    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (53.3%) toPonericin W5.Activity: Active against Gram+ bacteria S. aureus ATCC 25923, E. faecalis ATCC 29212, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, E. casseliflavus ATCC 700327 (MIC 4-8 uM). Gram- E. coli ATCC 25922, K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883 (MIC 8 uM), K. pneumoniae carbapanemase (KPC) MR, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 16-32 uM). Antiparasitic against Trypanosoma epimastigotes form T. cruzi (MIC 6.3 uM). The peptide also inhibits cancer cell proliferation (IC50 = 12.8 uM for B16F10 murine melanoma cells and  IC50=   15.3 uM  for MCF-7 human breast cancer cells) in a dose-dependent manner. The peptide is also antiviral against CHIKV (EC50 =17 uM), DENV4 (EC50 20.8 uM), and YFV (EC50=21.8 uM).  not toxic to noninfected Huh7 cells at 25 uM.Toxicity: It is moderate hemolytic HC50 49 uM (cf. mellitin HC50 5 uM).Structure:  Helical in 50% TFE.Peptide engineering: To imporve peptide stability, stapled peptides have been designed (e.g., F2-12) based on this sequence (Xue et al., 2024).Updated Jan2024",
