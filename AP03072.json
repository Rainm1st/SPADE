    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 78.7% similarity toplant defensin Vv-AMP1. GRAVY: -0.91; Mol Wt: 5466.339; Mol formula: C220H358N86O61S8. Most positively charged plant defensin identified today (also in the APD as of May 2019).Structure: it contains 3 beta strands and one helix. The 4 disulfide bonds  were included as restraints in the structure calculations: Cys3-Cys47; Cys14-Cys34; Cys20-Cys41; and Cys24-Cys43. Two prolines in trans conformation.Activity: Recombinant peptide is active against C. albicans in both the yeast and biofilm form as well as other Candida species, the filamentous fungus F. graminearum and E. coli in media containing 100 mM NaCl (salt-insensitive). Other fungi inhibited are C. auris (IC50 3.4 uM), C. glabrata ATCC 90030 (IC50 1.2 uM), C. krusei (IC50 0.9 uM), C. parapsilosis (IC50 1.3 uM), C. tropicalis ATCC 750 (IC50 0.5 uM), F. graminearum PH-1 (IC50 1.0 uM), bacteria S. aureus ATCC 9144 (IC50 1.5 uM), B. subtilis (IC50 0.4 uM), and P. aeruginosa PAO1 (IC50 1.7 uM).Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-insensitive:C. albicans (100 mM); NaCl-insensitive:C. krusei (100 mM); MgCl2-insensitive:C. albicans (5 mM); CaCl2-insensitive:C. albicans (2 mM);Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli:  Updated 7/2021",
