    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (51.85%) toModoCath4GRAVY: -1.45; Mol Ex Coeff: 0; mol formula:  C72H131N27O22; mol Wt: 1726.986;History:  Alboverticillin was initially isolated in 1958 and Triculamin isolated in 1967 before lasso was known and first isolated in 1991 (anantin).Structure: Unlike any known lasso peptides, their precursor peptides appear to have a follower instead of a leader peptide. Alboverticillin and triculamin share the same lasso structure based on overlayed NMR spectra. Composition: K:24% (four); R=S:12% (two each); I=V=P=D=6% (one each). A chemical bond between N-terminal NH2 of S1 with D8 (loss N+ and D-).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Activity: Alboverticillin and triculamin have the same activity spectra. Active against M. smegmatis (MIC 0.125-0.25 ug/ml), M. phlei (MIC 0.03-0.06 ug/ml), B-cereus (MIC >32 uM), E-faecium (MIC >32 uM), S-aureus (MIC >32 uM), K-oxytoca (MIC >32 uM), A-baumannii (MIC >32 uM), P-aeruginosa (MIC >32 uM), E-cloacae (MIC >32 uM).  Triculamin can kill a midexponential culture of M. smegmatis in 12 h.Antimicrobial robustness: It is heat-stable (no activity loss after treatment for 1, 4, and 8 h at 95oC. Agar diffusion). Resistant to carboxypeptidase Y.",
