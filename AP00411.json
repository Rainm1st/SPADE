  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Chemical modification:  Possibly a 69-residue C-terminal fragment cleaved from histone H1, probably phosphorylated at two residues.Activity: Active against M. luteus (MIC ~1.0 uM), P. citreus (MIC 0.8 uM), E. coli (MIC ~1 uM), and L. anguillarum (MIC ~ 1 uM). It had an effect on lipid bilayer as well.Toxicity: It displayed poor hemo-lytic activity (0.7% hemolysis at 0.8 uM).Updated 3/2010; 7/2021; 11/2023 GW.",
