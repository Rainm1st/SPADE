    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (90%) toM4K=R: 20%, others 10%.Peptide engineering:  the peptide is a branched form constructed on the platform of lysine to increase in vivo life time.  Warning: This dendrimer contains 4 chains of the same sequence shown.Activity: active against E. coli (MIC 8 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 or 885149 or 891 (MIC4-8 ug/ml),  K. pneumoniae W99FI0057 (MIC 4-16 ug/ml), P. mirabilis W99FI0089 or W03VA1144 (64->128 ug/ml), E. aerogenes W03BG0067 (MIC 4-8 ug/ml), A. baumannii AB1MG (MIC 16-32 ug/ml), C. freundii W99FI00007 (MIC 16 ug/ml),  B. epacia SMC71 (MIC 64 ug/ml), S.marcescens W99FI0111 (MIC> 128 ug/ml),  S.maltophilia PT4/99 (MIC >128 ug/ml), P.stuartii W03FI0001 (MIC>128 ug/ml), S. aureus ATCC 25923 or MIU-68A (MIC 64->128 ug/ml). mainly acttive against Gram- bacteria.MOA:bacteria:E. coli: It permeabilized inner membrane of E. coli ML-35. It also retarded DNA migration.Peptide stability in serum: peptide was detected after 24 h in human serum/plasma.In vivo toxicity: IP: LD50 2-3 mg/mouse, 125 mg/kg; IV: LD50 ~0.75 mg/mouse, 37.5 mg/kg (Pini et al., 2007).",
