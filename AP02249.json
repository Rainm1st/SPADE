    "Literature": "Discovery: A new peptide antibiotic has been discovered via a multichannel device, the iChip, to simultaneously isolate and grow uncultured bacteria.Structural characterization: An ester bond is formed between the backbone C-terminal Ile carboxylic acid and the side chain of Thr8. In addition, the N-terminal phe is methylated (XXM). There are 4 D-amino acids and enduracididine (represented with an Arg here).Activity: Active against primarily Gram-positive bacteria, including S. aureus MSSA or MRSA (MIC 0.25 ug/ml), E. faecalis (MIC 0.5 ug/ml) (anti-VRE), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (MIC <0.003 ug/ml), S. pyogenes (MIC 0.06 ug/ml), S. agalactiae (MIC 0.12 ug/ml), B. anthracis (MIC <=0.06 ug/ml), C. difficile (MIC 0.005 ug/ml), P. acnes (MIC 0.08 ug/ml), M. tuberculosis H37Rv (MIC 0.125 ug/ml) (anti-TB), H. influenzae (MIC 4 ug/ml), M. catarrhalis (MIC 2 ug/ml), E. coli MIC (25 ug/ml), P-aeruginosa (MIC >32 ug/ml), and K-pneumoniae (MIC >32 ug/ml).MOA:bacteria: this peptide inhibits both peptidoglycan and teichoic acid synthesis, causing cell lysis (Homma et al. 2016).Resistance development:no:bacteria:S. aureus: Resistance development:no:bacteria:M. tuberculosis: no mutants were identified on plates at 4xMIC. Resistance was not observed after 27 passages.3D Structure: Solid-state NMR observed the interaction of enduracididine with lipid II phosphate and established a beta-sheet structure, part of the large supramolecular fibrill (Shukla et al., 2022).SAR: One can only increase positive charges to 3 or 4 as an analog with 5 charges shows least activity (Abdel Monaim  et al. 2017). Alanine scan reveals that positions 10 and 3 can be changed without affecting activity (Chen et al. 2017).It is a potential lead.Updated 10/2017; 7/2021; 3/2022; 10/2022; 12/2024.",
