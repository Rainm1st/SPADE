    "Literature": "The N-terminal Q is pyroglutamate. There are three disulfide bonds: C1-C6; C2-C5; C3-C4, different from those of the vertebrate beta-defensins.  The protein showed strong antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. typhimurium as well as an enveloped rhabdovirus, Chandipura virus, which is an emerging human pathogen.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.
