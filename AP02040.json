    "Literature": "Discovery: Antimicrobial activity was observed as early as 1895 and the protein components crystallized in 1941. However, these effects are due to a mixture of purothionins till 1972. In this 1974 study, antibacterial activity of both mixture and separated alpha and beta-thionins were evaluated.Activity: the peptide showed activity against pathogens of plant origin. Crude (CP) active against S. uvarum CC-21 (MIC 32  ug/ml) inoculum 1000, S. uvarum CC-23 (MIC <4 ug/ml) inoculum 100000,and 2 ug/ml inoculum 1000, S. cerevisiae (MIC 8 ug/ml) inoculum 1000 and (MIC 32 ug/ml) inoculum 100000.Structure: Amino acid sequence was reported in 1977 (J Biochem). Refined crystal structure was reported in 1995 (see the PDB link).You can rotate, zoom, and view the tetrameric crystal structureherein the PDB.Updated 2/2014; Ref updated 3/2015; 7/2021.",
