  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "It is helical in SDS or TFE based on CD. 3D structure of anoplin in complex with DPC micelle is determined by 2D NMR (NMR_DPC)(Uggerh√∏j LE et al., 2014).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure on a micelleherein the PDB. The peptide appears to present ion channel-like activity (Dos Santos Cabrera MP et al 2008 J Pept Sci 14: 661-9). However, C-terminal amidation is not important for antifungal activity (BBA 2014). In the above 2014 NMR study, the structure-activity relationship (SAR) was explored, including the determination of the 3D structures of several mutants (R5W;R5K, T8W; andR5F, T8W).Surface immobilized peptide: Surface immobilization to chitosan polymers enahnced peptide activity and reduced peptide toxicity (Sahariah et al., 2015).
