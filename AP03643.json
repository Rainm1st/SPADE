GRAVY: 0.48; M Wt: 3065.887; Mol formula: C149H259N36O32; molar extinction coeff: 5550. leaderless.Activity: active against P. aeruginosa PAO1 and mutants (MIC 2-4 ug/ml), E. coli UB1005 (MIC 1 ug/ml), and S. typhimurium 14028s (MIC 4 ug/ml).Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-insensitive:P. aeruginosa MIC 2-4 ug/ml at 100-300 mM; MgCl2-sensitive:P. aeruginosa MIC increased from 4 ug/ml (1 mM) to 32 ug/ml (5 mM); sodium alginate-sensitive:P. aeruginosa MIC increased from 4 ug/ml (0.01%) to 64 ug/ml (0.1%). Also: KCl-insensitive:E. coli: 100 mM salt. Provided by Arjun Nair.",
