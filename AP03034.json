    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 94.1% similarity toFrenatin 2.1S.  35% Gly. Compared to Frenatin 2.1S, it contains only one additional glycine at the C-terminus. It would be identical to Frenatin 2.1S if the C-terminal Gly is converted to NH2.Activity: Active against yellow fever virus (YFV). At 20 ug/ml, a synthetic peptide showed 35% protective effect in Vero E6 cells infected with FYV.Toxicity:  it is not cytotoxic at 100 ug/ml to Vero E6 cells. Updated 6/2019; 7/2021",
