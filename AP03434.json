    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (53.56%) tocat FeCATHK: 16%; I=G=R=11%. Mol formula: C202H336N59O48S1; Mol Wt: 4429.297; Mol Ex Coeff: 5550; GRAVY:  -0.7516.Discovery: Identified via homologous sequence alignment with the conserved “cathelin” domain”.Chemical modification:  the N-terminus of the synthetic peptide is acetylated (XXE) while the C-terminus is amidated (XXA). Whether these modifications occur in the natural form remain established.Activity: Active against E. coli CECT 434 (MIC 6.25-12.5 uM), S. aureus CECT 794 (MIC 6.25–3.13 uM), C. jejuni CECT 9112 (MIC 1.56–0.78 uM), S. enterica CECT 456 (MIC 6.25–3.13 uM), and P. aeruginosa CECT 108 (MIC 25–12.5 uM).Toxicity:  16% hemolysis at 50 uM.Structure: predicted to be helical.
