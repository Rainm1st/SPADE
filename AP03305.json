    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (61.11%) tofrog \tSenegalinGRAVY: 1.16; Mol formula: C97H160N20O22; M. Wt: 1958.455, and Mol ex coeff.: 0.Structure: predicted to be helical.Activity:  In HSC-4 cells, SSTP1 induces growth inhibition with an IC50 value of 10.22 uM.MOA: It can induce apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway. This involves the association of the peptide with IL6/IL6R receptor followed by activation of JNK and phosphorylation of c-JUN.Toxicity:  the peptide can lyse RBC at 25 uM with a HC50 ~17 uM. The IC50 concentration of SSTP1 to HEK293 cells is 21.72 uM. This activity results from the action on cell membranes in general.",
