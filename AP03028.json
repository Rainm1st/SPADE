    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 38.5% similarity toXLAsp-P2.Activity: Active against E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 20 uM) and S. aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC 40.5 uM).Antimicrobial robustness: Important note: The anionic peptide identified as P1-L-1577 (net charge: -1) was dissolved in a buffer of zinc chloride and sodium chloride. In the absence of these ions, the peptide showed no inhibitory activity against any of the strains. 7/2021",
