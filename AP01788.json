    "Literature": "Expression: This peptide was constitutively expressed in native mussels in all the tissues, including hemocytes, gills, mantle, muscle, gonad, and digestive gland. It's also detected in oocytes and in larvae collected 2 and 24 h after fertilization. In addition, the Myt C expression level in hemocytes increased upon treatment with bacteria, implying its role in host defense.Activity: the longest synthetic peptide residues 1-40, active against E. coli (MIC 32 uM), P-aeruginosa (MIC >64 uM), E. faecalis (MIC 4 uM), S. aureus (MIC 64 uM), C. albicans (MIC 64 uM), and A-brasiliensis (MIC > 64 uM). MBC values are generally much higher. pH-sensitive: The activity is pH dependent. Only when tested at pH 5 was the reduced MytC as well as reduced and oxidized fragments including structural beta-elements able to inhibit Gram-positive and -negative bacteria (MIC ranges of 4-32 and 8-32 uM, respectively). Recently, the peptide was demonstrated to have antiviral and chemotactic activities as well (Balseiro P et al. PLoS One. 2011;6(8):e23140). Activity against a fish rhabdovirus. Possible four disulfide bonds. In contrast to results previously reported for oxidized isoforms of mussel myticins, reduced MytCc was not active against bacteria at physiological pH and showed a moderate antiviral activity against the viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) rhabdovirus. However, its chemotactic properties remained active (Martinez-Lopez A et al. 2013). Transcriptomic Analysis Reveals the Wound Healing Activity of Mussel Myticin C (Magal√≠ Rey-Campos et al., 2020).SAR: fragment 1-18 did not show activity till 64 uM; fragment 9-28 only showed activity against E. faecalis (MIC 16 uM); fragment 19-40 was active against most of the tested bacteria although weakly against P. aeruginosa and C. albicans. However, fragments shorter than 19-40 were essentialy inactive.Structure: Predicted to have an alpha-beta structure (Domeneghetti S et al., 2015).  Updated 9/4/2013; Jan2020.",
