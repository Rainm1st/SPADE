  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of  Hala4 shows 73.1% similarity toHalocin C8.  HalA4 and HalC8 have identical molecular masses and a similar stability pattern. It is likely a variant of HalC8.  Warning: The EXACT SEQUENCE could be longer than what is presented here obtained from Edman degradation.Discovery: Active against S. solfataricus (inhibition zone).Antimicrobial robustness: Activity is salt-independent.Peptide stability:  highly heat-stable, since it is resistant to boiling for up to a week (reviewed byBesse A et al., 2015).Formatted 11/2024",
