    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (38.46%) toSyCPA 153V: 57% (four), L=C=W=12% (i.e., one each in the sequence).  GRAVY: 3.17; Mol Wt: 817.065; Mol formula: C40H65N8O8S1; Mol ex coeff: 5612.5.Chemical modofication: This is a backbone modified peptide where V2, L4, and V6 are D-amino acids. In addition, a thiazolidin ring is formed between the sidechain of C1 and backbone carbonyl of V7.Activity: Active against Gram+ bacteria S. aureus USA300 (LAC) (MIC 1.5 ug/ml), S. aureus USA300 (NRS384) (MRSA) (MIC 1.5 ug/ml), S. pneumoniae (MIC 1.5 ug/ml), S. aureus Mu50 (MIC 3 ug/ml), S. aureus SA113 (MIC 3 ug/ml), S. aureus RN4220 (MIC 3 ug/ml), E. faecium BK463 (MIC 3 ug/ml) (Anti-VRE), E. faecalis VRE366 (MIC 12 ug/ml), L. monocytogenes ATCC19118 (MIC 6 ug/ml), B. subtilis 168 (trpC2) (MIC 4 ug/ml), Gram- P-aeruginosa PAO1 (MIC > 50 ug/ml) and E-coli (MIC > 50 ug/ml).Antimicrobial robustness: The peptide activity against MRSA was retained +50% human serum (serum-insensitive).MOA: it is proposed that after memrbane insertion this peptide forms hydrogen-bonded antiparallel beta-sheets which stack into peptide nanotubes as an monovalent cation channel that dissipates the membrane potential of bacteria. It is a potential lead.SAR: 3,7-diTrp-lugdunin (re-named 3,6- in a subsequent Nature paper on MOA) is more active, whereas methalated form is inactive (Ruppelt et al., 2024).Updated 9/2020; 7/2021; formatted 10/2022; 7/2023; 4/2024",
