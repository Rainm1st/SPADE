    "Literature": "Chemical modification: it is unique that T4 is phosphorylated. Residues 9 and 19 are dehydrated. Thioether rings between residues 9 and 14, between 19 and 24, and between 21 and 31.Warning: activity was tested using salivaricin 10, a mixture of peptides (AP3698-3700).Activity: active against Gram+ M. luteus ATCC10240 (MIC 0.125 ug/ml), S. pyogenes W51503011 or W80908630 (MIC 16 ug/ml), S. agalactiae W73106655 or W70407881 (MIC 16-32 ug/ml), S. pneumoniae V4122578 or W81002644 (MIC 0.5-1 ug/ml), drug-resistant E. faecalis W82000259 or W80909324 or ATCC29212 (MIC 16-32 ug/ml), E. faecium W97542221 (MIC 64 ug/ml) anti-VRE, L-rhamnosus ATCC11981 (MIC>64 ug/ml), S-mutans UA159 (MIC > 64 ug/ml), Gram- N. gonorrhoeae V3091967 (MIC 64 ug/ml), P. gingivalis ATCC33277 (MIC 32 ug/ml), and T. forsythia ATCC43037 (MIC 32 ug/ml). Primarily kill oral pathogens in a selective manner.Proinflammatory: salivaricin 10 is able to increase the levels of proinflmmatory CD63 and CD66 similar to pathogens or crude peptide preparation. The phosphorylated peptide appears to be important for this activation.",
