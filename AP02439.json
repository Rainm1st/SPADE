    "Literature": "Activity: Active against human malaria parasite P. falciparum (LC50 35 nM). MOA: It targets the ribosome. Also active against M. tuberculosis (anti-TB) (Degiacomi G et al., 2016) and hepatitis C virus (Lee M et al., 2016);Chemical modification: Extensive post-translational modifications are involved to generate the final peptide form, similar to thiostrepton (another thiopeptide) for veterinary uses.Structure: The macrocyclic structure was determined in 2000 by NMR (Carnio MC et al. 2000).Staphylococcus equorum WS 2733 was known to produce MP1. Found in multiple species.Updated 11/2015; 11/2017; 10/2024.",
