  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Dermaseptin-L1 was active against the Gram-negative bacterium E. coli (MIC 8 uM) but inactive against the Gram-positive bacterium S.aureus. This peptide inhibited growth of zoospores of the chytrid fungus B. dendrobatidis at concentrations above 25 uM but did not completely inhibit growth at 100 uM.Toxicity: Dermaseptin-L1 showed selective cytolytic activity against HepG2 human hepatoma-derived cells (LC50 45 uM) compared with human erythrocytes (LC50 200 uM).",
