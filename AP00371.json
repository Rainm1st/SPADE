Globigii (MIC 0.6 uM), Gram- S. choleraesuis C78-1 (MIC 1.56 ug/ml), S. typhimurium SL1344 (MIC 3.12-4 ug/ml), P. avium C48-3 (MIC 3.12 ug/ml), S. choleraesuis C78-1 (MIC 1.56 ug/ml), E. coli  ATCC 25922 (MIC 1-2 uM), and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 or PAO1 (MIC 1.25-2.5 uM). Bind LPS, suppress LPS-induced cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha (Anti-inflammatory).Viruses:  exhibited antiviral activity against the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an important porcine pathogen  (Pashaie et al., 2025).Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-insensitive:S. aureus ATCC25923; NaCl-insensitive:P. aeruginosa GIM1.551. CaCl2-insensitive:S. aureus; CaCl2-insensitive:P. aeruginosa. serum-insensitive.  pH-sensitive especially above pH 12; activity reduced with boiling time to 120 min.MOA:bacteria:E. coli: permeabilibed bacterial inner membranes.Toxicity:  less than 5% at the tested concentrations up to 1280 ug/ml. little hemo.lytic. Also, mouse embryo fibroblast cell line NIH 3 T3 cells survived over 80% (MTT assays) up to 1280 ug/ml (Chen et al., 2020).Structure:  random coil in water and helical in 30-45% TFE.Animal model:mouse: more animal survived with the peptide treatment for 3 days (10 ug/day).Updated Jan2024; formatted 9/2024; 11/2024; 4/2025",
