  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Active against E. coli (MIC 8.5 uM), S-aureus (MIC >80 uM) and S-epidermis (MIC >80 uM).Toxicity:  the compound, however, is also quite toxic (50% hemolysis of human type A blood cells: HC50 13.3 uM) highly hemolytic. Also TOXIC To HeLa cells (50% survival: IC50 1.2 uM).Discovery: This is an uncyclized cyclotide (i.e. uncyclotides). Compared to cyclotides, the C-terminal D/N critical for cyclization is lacking due to a premature stop codon. Surprisingly, this linear form is not only more abundant in the plant but also more active than the circular peptides identified in the same species.SAR: ChaC11A is an Met oxidized form of the native peptide identified during purification. This oxidized form lost its activity compared to the native form.APD update 6/21/2012; 4/2015, 7/2021; 4/2024; 7/2024",
