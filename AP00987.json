  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "It has a hybrid peptide sequence. While the N-terminus is rich in Pro and Arg, the C-terminus has the potential of forming 2 S-S bonds: C25-C34 and C27-C32.Activity: Natural and synthetic arasin 1 displayed similar activity profiles. Active against L. anguillarum (MIC 6.3 uM), E. coli (MIC 12.5 uM), C. glutamicum (MIC 0.8 uM). However, MBC values are much higher.SAR: Further, the N-terminal fragment (residues 1-23) appeared to have the same activity as the full length peptide.  Like the N-terminal fragment of PR-39, the mechanism of action of the N-terminal fragment might be concentration dependent(Paulsen VS et al. 2013). Screening of the gene knockout library of E. coli revealed two inner membrane proteins YgdD and SbmA are required for the complete susceptibility of E. coli to arasin 1(1-25) (Paulsen VS et al., 2016).
