  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence  is 59.4% similar toreptile Cathelicidin-BF.Activity: Active against E. coli ATCC25922 (MIC 0.64 uM), S. dysenteriae (0.16 uM), K. pneumoniae (1.29-21 uM), K. oxytoca (MIC 1.3 uM), P. mirabilis (1.3 uM), S. maltophilia (2.6 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC27853 (MIC 5.2-10.3 uM), S. paratyphi A (1.3 uM), Gram+ S. aureus ATCC25923 (1.3 uM),  B. cereus (2.6 uM), B. subtilis (20.7 uM), E. faecium (10.3 uM), N. asteroides (2.6 uM), fungi C. albicans (0.64-1.3 uM), and A. cinerea (2.6 uM). In addition, it showed activity against aquatic pathogenic bacteria A. sobria,  A. hydrophila, A. veronii, V. splendidus,  E. tarda (MIC 0.64 uM), V. vulnificus, V. harveyi, V. fluvialis, V. alginolyticus,  V. parahaemdyticus, (MIC 1.3-2.6 uM),  and V. anguillarum (5.2 uM). This peptide also showed good activity against aquatic bacteria Gram- V. alginolyticus (MIC 2.59 uM), V. anguillarum, V. brasiliensis (MIC 1.29 uM), V. cholerae (MIC 0.64 uM), V. fluvialis, V. harveyi (MIC 1.29 uM),  V. parahaemolyticus (MIC 0.64 uM),  V. splendidus (MIC 1.29 uM),  V. vulnificus. (MIC 2.59 uM), A. hydrophila (MIC 1.29 uM), A. sobria (MIC 2.59 uM),  A.veronii (MIC 2.59 uM), and N. asteroides (MIC 1.29) (Ouyang et al., 2022). It also shows antibiofilm activity and anti-inflammatory activity. This cathelicidin also inhibits Zika virus (ZIKV) (Wang et al., 2022) via direct inactivation and the interferon pathway, similar to human cathelicidin LL-37 and its peptides (He et al., 2022).Antimicrobial robustness:  Activity is relaltively insensitive to salts (salt-insensitive).SAR: Decrease in positively charged K/R by alanine substituions led to reduced activity. Scambled Hc-CATH had no activity.Toxicity:  It showed low hemolysis and cytotoxicity at 200 ug/ml to HepG2, PC3, L929, and mouse peritoneal macrophages (1-5%). At 200 uM, it caused 28% and 34.9% deaath of fish cells EPC and FHM, respectively. Updated 7/2021; 2/2022; 10/2022",
