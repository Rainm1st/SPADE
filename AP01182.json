  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: Enterococcus faecium IT62, a strain isolated from ryegrass in Japan, produces three bacteriocins (enterocins L50A, L50B, and IT) encoded in differnt plasmids. Vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VRE) strain VRE200 harbors the highly efficient conjugative gentamicin resistance plasmid pG200 (70 kb) and bacteriocin plasmid pTI1 (12.5 kb). The bacteriocin encoded on pTI1 (plasmid-encoded) was designated bacteriocin 32 (Bac 32). Bac 32 and entIT are identical (Izquierdo et al., 2009). Found in multiple species.Activity: Bacteriocin 32 was active against E. faecium, E. hirae, and E. durans but showed no activity against L.monocytogenes. Updated 8/2023",
