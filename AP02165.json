  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Similar to Gallidermin and epidermin. The fourth residue was phenylalanine in BacCH91 but lysine in both epidermin and gallidermin, which explains the more hydrophobic character of BacCH91. The peptide was thus purified by first extraction with organic solvents followed by HPLC purification.",
