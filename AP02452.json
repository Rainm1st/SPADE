  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "By Northern blot analysis, eotaxin-3 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the heart and ovary. Eotaxin-3 was chemotactic for normal peripheral blood eosinophils and basophils via the CCR3 receptor (Kitaura M et al., 1999). Antimicrobial activity was demonstarted in 2014.Activity: Active against the airway pathogens S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, Non-typeable H. influenzae, and P. aeruginosa. NMR structure was solved in 2001 (Ye J et al., 2001).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.  Reg 12/10/2014.",
