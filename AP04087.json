    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (47.83%) toSaha-CATH5R: 29%; K=I: 24%. It is a cathelicidin (P7) and aurein (A3) hybrid followed by truncation to reduce toxicity. PA13 is one of the fragment.Activity: Active against E. coli (MIC 31.0 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa ATCC27853 or 14 MDR clinical strains (MIC 3.91-16.0 ug/ml), K. pneumonia (MIC 16.0 ug/ml), E. faecium (MIC 4.0 ug/ml), S. aureus (MIC 2.0 ug/ml), and C. acnes (MIC 16.0 ug/ml).Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-sensitive:P. aeruginosa (150 mM), kCl-insensitive:P. aeruginosa (4.5 mM), MgCl2-sensitive:P. aeruginosa (1 mM), NH4Cl-insensitive:P. aeruginosa (6 uM), ZnCl2-insensitive:P. aeruginosa (8 uM), FeCl3-insensitive:P. aeruginosa (4 uM), CaCl2-insensitive:P. aeruginosa (2.5 uM),",
