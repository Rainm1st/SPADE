  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Chemical modificationy: N-terminus is a pyroglutamate (XXQ).Activity: Initially implicated in angiogenesis (angiogenic) and human cancer with weak RNase activity (ribonuclease activity). It is also established that this peptide is active against C. albicans and S. pneumoniae. Another paper: this peptide also specifically inhibited M. tuberculosis (Mtb, anti-TB).activity robustness: Antimicrobial activity was not influenced up to 50 mM NaCl, but compromised at higher concentrations of NaCl (75-150 mM) (Salt-sensitive).Structure: In solution, the side-chain of His114 adopts two main conformations. The solution NMR structureEur J Biochem. 1997is similar to the previous crystal structure (NMR+x). There are multiple crystal structures.You can rotate, zoom, and view the crystal structure 1B1Iherein the PDB.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: it has been expressed.
