  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide most resembles (57.1% similarity)NRC-19. L=H=17%.Activity: A 17-residue segment was used to test peptide activity. Active against Gram- E. coli (MIC 45 uM),  E-tarda (MIC >90 uM), V. tapetis (MIC 22.5 uM), Gram+ S. iniae (MIC 45 uM), fungi C. albicans KCCM 11282 (MIC 22.5 uM), S. cerevisiae (MIC 11.25 uM), and parasite M. avidus (MIC 0.4 uM).NMR Structure: residues 2-17 are helical in DPC and 2-19 are helical in SDS micelles. 3D structure of Of-Pis1 bound to DPC was determined (Martina Bischetti  et al., 2022).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.SAR: Taken together the above two studies, the 17-residue fragment used for activity assay corresponds closely to the helical region of the peptide and reflects the activity of the entire peptide since the C-terminal region is disordered and not involved in membrane targeting for antibacterial activity.
