    "Literature": "Recombinant form of the defensin is highly effective (MIC <10uM) against filamentous fungi, especially Trichoderma viride, F. culmorum, and F. oxysporum, and yeast C. albicans, and to a low extent S. cerevisiae, and bacteria S. aureus. It is also active against parasite promastigotes of L. major (MHOM/YE/84).",
