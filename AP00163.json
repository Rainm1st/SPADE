    "Literature": "Activity: Active against S. aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC 3.0 uM), P. aeruginosa CIP A22 (MIC 4.6 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 11.6 uM) and E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 5.0 uM), and E. coli 54127 (MIC 2.3 uM). The insulin-releasing peptide IRP from the skin of Phyllomedusa trinitatis frog shares the identical sequence but not C-terminal amidation (Marenah L et al., 2004 Pancreas. Aug;29(2):110-5). Active against E. coli (MIC 5 uM) and S. aureus (MIC 3 uM) (Proaño-Bolaños C et al., 2016). It has the potential to be developed into molecules that treat patients with Type 2 diabetes (T2D).
