  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Active against E. coli (MIC 6.4 uM), not active against S-aureus and S-epidermis till 80 uM (MIC >80 uM).Toxicity: The compound, however, is also quite toxic (50% hemolysis of human type A blood cells: HL50 11.6 uM). TOXIC TO HeLa cells (IC50 1.2 uM). This is an acyclic peptide.SAR: Compared to cyclotides, the C-terminal D/N critical for cyclization is lacking. Surprisingly, this linear form is not only more abundant but also more active than the circular peptides identified in the same plant. APD updated 4/2015; 7/2021.",
