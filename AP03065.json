  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 81.2% similarity toHD-5.  It is assumed that a similar process occurs in vivo under a reduced condition.Activity: Highly active against various commensal bacteria B. subtilis 168trpC; B breve, B. lonqum, B. adolescentis Ni3,29c, B. vulqatus, E. coli MC1000, L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus, L. salivarius, and S. solivarius salivarius. In addition, it is active against A. baumannii 4-MRGN (MIC 25 uM), K.pneumoniae 3-MRGN (inactive), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 50 uM), E. faecium 475747 (MIC 25 uM), and S.aureus USA300 (inactive). The discovery of HD-5 active fragments indicate the complex of host defense peptides and potential role in regulating the microbiome. Updated 7/2021",
