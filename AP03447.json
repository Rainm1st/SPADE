  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (96.67%) tohuman cathelicidin fragment KS-30GRAVY: -0.955; M. Wt: 3516.139; Mol formula: C157H269N47O43; Mol Ex Coeff: 0.host protease cleavage: host proteases can also cleave LL-37 into a fragment like this (ref needed).pathogen cleavage: This peptide is an intermediate Candida albicans cleaved product. It can be cleaved into even smaller fragments by  secreted aspartic proteases, leading to total inactivation of LL-37. In a different case, Group A Streptococcus (GAS) has also been reported to be able to secrete protease ScpC to cleave LL-37 into LL8 and SK-29, reducing peptide chemotactic property rather than antibacterial activity. SK-29 inhibited GAS strains M14 (JS95) and M1T1 (854) (MIC 20-25 uM) (Biswas et al., 2021).Activity: SK-29 is active against C. albicans (MIC data not reported). Like LL-37, it also retains ROS stimulation activity from neutrophils. It demonstrated weaker apoptosis inhibitory activity as well as IL-8 release from neutrophils.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: a bacterial expression system has been established for this peptide (Li etal., 2007).Updated 10/2022; 4/2023",
