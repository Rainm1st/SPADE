    "Literature": "This is THE FIRST INDUCIBLE ANTIFUNGAL PROTEIN FROM INSECTS. The expression is induced via the TOLL pathway. Only active against filamentous fungi, including A. fumigatus (MIC 6.25 uM),  A. ustus (MIC 25 uM), F. solani (MIC 25 uM),  F. oxysporum (MIC 6.25 uM) (Data fromSimon A et al., 2008). However, it is not active against tested Gram-positive (S.aureus, Streptococcusgroup A, E.faecalis, MIC >50 uM), Gram-negative (E. coli, K.pneumoniae, S.serovar Enteritidis, P.aeruginosa, MIC >50 uM), and yeast strains (C.albicans, C.glabrata, C.tropicalis, C.krusei, and C.neoformans, MIC >50 uM).   The structure, consisting of an helix and a twisted 3-stranded beta-sheet, is stabilized by three disulfide bonds.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.  Refer to Landon C et al. (1997) Protein Sci. 6: 1878-1884. Similar folds were found in defensins and scorpion toxins. Transgenic plants: expression of this peptide in tobacco improves resistance to pathogens (Montesinos E 2007 FEMS Microbiol Lett 270, 1-11). Updated Jan 2014; 04/2017; 7/2021 GW",
