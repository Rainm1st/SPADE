    "Literature": "Host expression:Constitutive: expressed in human sweat glands (1-10 ug/mL).AMP Significance: Deficiency in dermcidin-derived peptides in human sweat of AD patients correlates with impaired innate defense in skin (Rieg S et al. 2005 J Immunol 174: 8003-10).Activity: In vitro MIC against E. coli, E. faecalis and S. aureus at ~1 ug.mL, and at 10 ug.mL C. albicans. Also active against P. acnes (ref).SAR: N-terminal cationic fragments SSL-23 and SSL-25 are active against both a select set of G+ and G- bacteria. However, a 30-residue C-terminal fragment and a N-terminal 29mer (SSL-29, neutral) were found to be inactive.MOA:bacteria:  This anionic peptide DCD may kill microbes by targeting bacterial envelope in a mechanism different from that of cationic LL-37 (Steffen H et al 2006 Antimicrob Agents Chemother 50: 2608-2620).Structure:  In 2013, the crystal structure of dermcidin was also reported (Visit the PDB link).You can rotate, zoom, and view the hexameric crystal structureherein the PDB.  A channel was proposed based on the crystal structure. (Resistance problem) The decreased sensitivity of P. aeruginosa to DCD-derived peptides is not mediated by proteolytic degradation under physiological conditions (Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2009 Feb 6). For a review of dermcidin, please refer to Schittek B (2012) The multiple facets of dermcidin in cell survival and host defense.J Innate ImmunMarch 27 online. Notably, in melanoma, dermcidin is over-expressed. Selectively targeting dermcidin with a small molecule seriniquinone led to cancer cell death (Trzoss L et al., 2014).
