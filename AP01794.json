  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis in 3/2020 revealed this sequence is 64.3% similar toTemporin-1RNa.Activity: Active against S. aureus, B. cereus, S. lactis (MIC 14.4 uM).   Active against plant pathogens Gram-  E. amylovora (MIC 25-50 uM),  X. arboricola pv. pruni and X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria (MIC 3.1-6.2 uM) (Camó C et al. 2018).MOA:  It appears to kill breast cancer cells by membrane disruption (Wang C et al., 2013). In particular, human A375 melanoma cells express 50-fold more phosphatidylserine (PS) expressed on cancer cell surface serves as a target for temporin-1CEa. Anticancer activity is reduced by annexin V, which binds PS. The peptide is also anti-inflammatory by suppressing the levels of TNFalpha and IL-6 by inhibiting NFkB and MyD88 pathways (Zhang et al., 2021).Structure: Temporin-1CEa adopted a well-defined helical structure in 50% TFE/water solution.
