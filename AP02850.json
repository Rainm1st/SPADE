    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide shows 56.4% similarity toLaterosporulin.  Defensin-like means three potential disulfide bonds;  Molecular formula:  C265H410N73O75S7; Mol Wt 6068.058; GRAVY=  -0.428; Wimley-White whole-residue hydrophobicity of the peptide:  9.6  kcal/mol.Activity: microtitre plate Alamar blue assay: Active against microbial pathhogens such as M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv (LD50 0.5 uM) and S. aureus (LD50 4.0 uM). It killed M. tuberculosis (anti-TB) residing inside the macrophages without any antagonistic activity against macrophages.MOA: It appears to work on the membranes of bacteria as well as cancer cells.Toxicity: Also active against cancer cells like MCF-7, HEK293T, HT1080, HeLa and H1299 at below 10 uM concentration, but not against prostate epithelium cells RWPE-1 and no hemolysis at 40 uM.
