    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide most resembles (55% similarity)scorpion AamAP2. Active against Gram+ S. aureus and S. agalactiaea (MIC 2.5 uM) and Gram-negative E. coli and P. aeruginosa (24 and 2.5 uM) as well yeasts C. albicans (MIC 6.25 uM).  Also active against M. tuberculosis H37Rv and M. tuberculosis MDR (anti-TB). It is hemolytic HL50 9.2 uM. VpAmp1.1 is a shortened derivative (sequence: FFLLSLIPSAISAIKKI-amide). Helical in 60% TFE.",
