    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (55.56%) toTetraF2W-KKL=K: 38%, W: 25%Activity: active against E. coli (MIC 64 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa (MIC 64 ug/ml), S. aureus MRSA (MIC 64 ug/ml), and E.faecalis (MIC 256 ug/ml). Inhibited biofilm formation:S. aureus, Inhibited biofilm formation:P. aeruginosa.Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-insensitive:E. coli (150 mM), NaCl-insensitive:P. aeruginosa (150 mM), NaCl-insensitive:S. aureus (150 mM). Human serum-sensitive (10%).SAR:  LK4 activity reduced due to insertion of one more LK unit.In vitro toxicity: low hemo.lytic (<30%) even at 512 ug/ml.",
