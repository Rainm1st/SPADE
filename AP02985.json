    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 57.1% similarity toCatestatin. It corresponds to residues 344-358 of Chromogranin A, an arginine rich N-terminal fragment of Catestatin. GRAVY -0.87; Mol Wt  1860.183; Mol ex. coeff 1490.Activity: Active against Gram-positive M. luteus (MIC 0.8 uM), B. megaterium (MIC 0.8 uM), Gram-negative bacteria E. coli D22 (MIC 8 uM), Filamentous fungi N. grassa (MIC 1.2 uM), A. fumigatus (MIC 10 uM), N. haematococca (MIC 0.2 uM), F. culmorum (MIC 2 uM), F. oxysporum (MIC 6 uM), T. mentagrophytes (MIC 4 uM), yeast cells C. albicans (MIC 1.2 uM), C. tropicalis (MIC 1.8 uM), C. glabrata (MIC 8 uM), and C. neoformans (MIC 1.4 uM) (see the ref). Also active against C. albicans (MIC 2.9 uM for the D-form and 4.2 uM for the L-form).Antimicrobial robustness: The D-form remains stable in saliva. Rodamine-labled peptide is able to enter C. albincans in 30 min (Pauline Dartevelle  et al. 2018).Structure:  the peptide is flexible in water but can become helical in memrbane-mimetic DPC micelles (Frantz Jean-Fran√ßois et al. 2007). 6/2018; 7/2021; 4/2022",
