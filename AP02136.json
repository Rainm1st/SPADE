    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: 55.56% similar to AP3117 (Greater amberjack piscidin). I: 29%; H: 24%; A=G=R: 10%.Chemical modification:  the last Glycine can be converted to C-terminal amidation (e.g., GAD-1) (McDonald M et al., 2015).Toxicity: These authors found that both Gad-1 and Gad-2 demonstrated concentration-dependent cytotoxicity against LLC cells, HEY ovarian cancer cells, and PC3 prostate cancer cells.Activity: Ruangsri  et al. found it active against Gram-positive bacteria M. luteus (M. lysodeikticus) ATCC 4698, P. citreus NCIMB 1493, C. glutamicum ATCC 13032, S. aureus ATCC 9144 (MIC , 0.04-5 uM) and Gram-negative bacteria E. coli ATCC 25922, V. anguillarum NCIMB 2133, V. anguillarum NCIMB 2129, Y. ruckeric NCIMB 2196, Y. ruckeric VI-3629, and P. immobilisc NCIMB 308 (MIC 0.3-10 uM). Active against P. aeruginosa {AO1 (MIC 2 uM at pH 6.4 but 16 uM at pH 7.4) pH-sensitive. Likewise it's more active at pH 6.4 in the presence of 0.2% DNA (Portelinha and Angeles-Boza, 2021). It can inhibit biofilm formation and disrupt preformed biofilms:bacteria:P. aeruginosa.MOA:bacteria: It can enter bacteria and bind to DNA followed by DNA cleavage in the presence of Cu2+ (cleavage rate: 0.060 min-1 vs. 0.037 min-1 by Cu2+ itself). The generation of ROS may be responsible for DNA cleavage.Structure:  The C-terminal 17 residues are helical in SDS.Synergy:antibiotics: it showed synrergistic antibiofilm activity with antibiotics such as kanamycin and ciprofloxacin.Updated 4/2015; 4/2024.",
