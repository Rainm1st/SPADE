    "Literature": "Activity: Active against B. cereus (MIC 100 ug/ml), E.coli (MIC> 100 ug/ml), L. lactis (MIC 3 uM), L. innocua (MIC 50 ug/ml), M. luteus (MIC 12.5 ug/ml), S. aureus ATCC 25923 or 29213 (MIC 12.5-50 ug/ml, S. epidermidis (MIC 50 ug/ml), and S. uberis (MIC 50 ug/ml). By similarity, it contains two amphipathic helices separated by a region of less-defined helicity and greater flexibility.This peptide could inhibit HIV infection (VanCompernolle et al., 2015).SAR: removal of the N-terminal 2 residues inactivated the peptide.Updated 7/2012, 6/2015. 4/2019 CW; 12/2024 GW",
