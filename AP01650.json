    "Literature": "Discovery: Initially identified as a toxin from rattlesnake (Habermann E 1953 Biochem Z 329: 405-415).Activity: It's now found to have multiple functions, including cell-penetrating (targeting lysosomes) and antimicrobial activities (see ref). Active against P. falciparum. Crotamine preferentially targets eukaryotic cells over prokaryotic Kv channels.Structure:  The initial NMR structure  (PDB: 1H5O) determined by Nicastro G et al. (2003 Eur J Biochem 270: 1969) is verified and refined recently using 2D NMR data collected on a 900-MHz NMR spectrometer (go to the PDB link). The fold (alpha: 1-7; beta 9-13 and 34-38; Disulfide bonds: 4-36, 11-30 and 18-37) is similar to beta-defensins. NMR+x:  This fold is also maintained in the crystal (Coronado MA et al., 2012).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. It might have antitumor activity as well (Pereira A et al. 2011 Expert Opin Investig Drugs 20:1189-200). CyLoP-1 (Cytosol Localizing Peptide-1) is cell penetrating and antimicrobial peptide derived from crotamine. It is engineered based on the Crot(27-29) putative nuclear localization sequence of the peptide (Jha D et al., 2011).Updated 8/19/11; 2/2014; 11/2016; 11/2023; 12/2024. GW.",
