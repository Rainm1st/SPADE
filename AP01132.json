    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (38.46%) toP-02K: 16%; GRAVY: -0.524; M. Wt: 3088.594; Mol formula: C149H220N37O35; Mol Ex Coeff: 8530;Activity:  XX.Animal model:mouse: protect against P. aeruginosa sepsis, mainly via reduction of both systemic cytokine responses and excessive coagulation.Anti-inflammatory: GKY25 binds to LPS and interferes with TLR4/myeloid differentiation protein-2 dimerization, leading to inhibition of TLR4 dimerization and subsequent reduction of NF-kB activity and proinflammatory cytokine production in monocytes and macrophages (Hansen et al., 2015).The original entry kalata B9 linear has been merged with entry 1108 due to the same sequence.",
