  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence  is 31.2% similar totick Ixodidin. Active against S. aureus, S. pyogenes (MIC 2-5 mg/mL), S. mitis, E. faecalis, E. coli (MIC 10 mg/mL), S. pneumoniae (MIC 1), and L. pneumophila. The peptide was initially isolated and characterized as a flocculating protein(Gassenschmidt U et al., 1995). The N-terminal Q is a pyroglutamate (XXQ). Thus, attempts were made to adsorb this protein to sand granules for clarifying and disinfecting water(Jerri HA et al., 2012). CryoEM experiments observed that MOCP fused the inner and outer membranes of E. coli(Shebek K et al., 2015).",
