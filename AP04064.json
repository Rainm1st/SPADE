    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (97.3%) toparent \tPMAP-37Activity: Active against Gram+ S. aureusATCC25923 (MIC 0.025 ug/ml), S. epidermidis LY8 (MIC 25 ug/ml), L. monocytogenes CICC21533 (MIC 31.25 ug/ml), B. subtilis CICC24434 (MIC 0.78 ug/ml), Gram- S. choleraesuis C78-1 (MIC 0.78 ug/ml), S. typhimurium SL1344 (MIC 0.78 ug/ml), P. avium C48-3 (MIC 1.56 ug/ml), and E. coli CICC10004 (MIC 6.25 ug/ml).Antimicrobial robustness: pH-sensitive especially above pH 12; activity reduced with boiling time to 120 min.Recombinant production:yeast:Pichia pastoris: this variant has been expressed and further characterized.Animal model:mouse: more animal survived with the peptide treatment for 3 days.Peptide conjugate: coupling cholesterol at the N-terminus of the peptide increased peptide activity, stability and in vivo efficacy (Chen et al., 2020).",
