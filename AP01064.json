    "Literature": "Active against nematode parasites of sheep (e.g. Haemonchus contortus or Trichostrongylus colubriformis).  Also, active against plant fungi F. oxysporum (MIC 12.5-25 uM), B. cinerea (MIC 3 uM),  C. utrechtense (MIC 6.25 uM), A. alternatam (MIC 3 uM) (Slazak et al. 2018). It inhibited HIV-1 infection in cultured human T-lymphoblast (CEM-SS) cells (EC50 320 nM) and cytotoxicity (TC50 6.4 uM), therapeutic index (~20)(Ireland et al., 2008). Updated 7/2021",
