    "Literature": "Discovery: Warning: the exact cleavage site is predicted. Eight members are reported (arminins 1b, 1c, 2a, 2b, 2c, 3a, and 3b). Other arminins have not been registered into this database due to the lack of antimicrobial data.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: Arminin 1a has been expressed in E. coli.Activity: The recombinant peptide showed activity against E. coli DH5alpha or WT E4 or E9  (MBC 0.2-0.4 uM), B. megaterium ATCC 14581 (MBC 0.1 uM), and S. aureus ATCC 12600 or MRSA ATCC 43300 or ATCC 33393 or WT 344 355 or 358 (MBC 0.4-0.8 uM). In particular, synthetic version of the peptide with C-terminal amidation inhibits gram-positive vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis ATCC 51299 (MBC 1.6 uM) (anti-VRE) and 4 strains E. faecium strains 354, 356, G70 and G71 (MBC 0.4-0.8 uM). It was also active against gram-negative ESBL strain K. pneumoniae (MBC 0.4-0.8 uM).Antimicrobial robustness: The peptide remained to be active under physiological salt conditions: NaCl-insensitive:E. coli (200 mM); NaCl-insensitive:S. aureus (200 mM), NaCl-sensitive:B. megaterium .Toxicity:  it is not toxic to human red blood cells (erythrocytes): human RBC: not hemo.lytic (HC50 >>100 uM).  Arminin-1a-C with C-terminal amidation was made to test activity against leukemia cells. It rapidly membranes of MDR cancer cells.Structure:  Helical in TFE (Liang X et al., 2018).Updated 12/2018; 4/2024",
