  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (34.6%) tofrog Brevinin-2EThus, this is a unique sequence.Chemical modification: Two disulfide bonds (C4-C47 and C32-C38), S37 and T46 are N-acetylglucosamine modified  (O-linked glycopeptide).Activity:  Active against E. faecalis JCM 5803T (MIC 1.87 uM), E. durans NBRC 100479T (MIC 15 uM), E. mundtii JCM 8731T (MIC 0.94 uM), B. coagulans JCM 2257T (MIC 1.87 uM), E. coli JM109 (MIC 1.87 uM), and and P. vulgaris F24B (MIC 3.74 uM). Activity to multiple other bacteria > 30 uM.Antimicrobial robustness:  sensitive to proteases, active at wide pH, moderate resistance to heat.Note that a long form (including the leader sequence EMEAVKGG) was expressed in Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 and found to be more active against E. faecalis JCM 5803T (MIC 0.93 uM), E. coli JM109 (MIC 0.46 uM), S. enterica subsp. enterica NBRC 13245T (MIC 0.23 uM), and P. vulgaris F24B (MIC 0.23 uM). This study also indicates that the leader sequence was cleaved after the peptide was secreted (Maky et al., 2021).",
