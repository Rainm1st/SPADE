    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (62.96%) toChBac3.4The synthesis of the full length was not successful. So, a truncated form was made.Activity: Active against Gram- E. coli O157:H7, 0111, UB1005; rough K-12 strain, ATCC25922 (MIC 2-25 ug/ml), S. enterica serovar Typhimurium 14028s (MIC 0.5 ug/ml), S. enterica serovar Typhimurium MS4252S (phoPQ mutant; defensin supersusceptible) (MIC 0.125), P. aeruginosa PAO1, 61 (MIC 4-8 ug/ml), Gram+ S. aureus NCTC 4163 or MRSA R147 or 1056 MRSA (MIC 16-64 ug/ml or greater), S. epidermidis clinical isolate (MIC 16 ug/ml), E. faecalis ATCC 29212 (MIC 32 ug/ml), and yeast C. albicans 105 or 3153A (MIC 32-64 ug/ml).MOA: Deletion of E. coli sbmA led to activity increase by 4-fold, indicative of inhibit an intracellular target such as ribosome. appeared to have an effect on bacterial membranes as well.Toxicity: not hemo.lytic to till 400 ug/ml: rabbit RBC. Recombinant OaBac5mini exhibited no cytotoxicity on IPEC-J2 and RAW 264.7 cells (Shen et al., 2023).Recombinant production:bacteria: an Escherichia coli expression system has been established.Animal model:chick: recombinant OaBac5mini alleviated inflammation by modulating innate immunity through the TLR4/MyD88/NF-kB pathway and by suppressing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Shen et al., 2023).
