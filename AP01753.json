    "Literature": "Activity: The native and synthetic peptides showed essentially the same antibacterial activity against clinical isolates of Gram-negative multidrug resistant pathogens: P. aeruginosa 5 strains (MIC 17.7-100 uM), K. pneumoniae 5 strains (MIC 17.7-50 uM), E. coli IC (4.4-20 uM), E. cloacae strains (MIC 4.4 uM and >20 uM) and A. baumanii 3 strains (MIC 5-20 uM) causing nosocomial infections.SAR: The peptide lost its activity when the N-terminal 8 residues were deleted (Vm29).In vitro toxicity:  Human RBC: Not hemo.lytic. HC50 100 uM.Structure: The peptide is helical in 60% TFE.Seq updated 5/2015; 7/2021",
