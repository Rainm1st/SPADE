    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 87.5% similarity tofrog Brevinin-1AUa. GRAVY: 1.23; Mol Wt: 2527.215; Mol formula: C118H205N27O28S2.Activity: Active against fungal pathogens B.  dendrobatidis Bd (MIC 12.5 uM) and B. salamandrivorans (MIC 12.5 uM).SAR: A substitution of leucines to isoleucines (seq: FLPIIAGIAANIVPKIICSITKKC) led to a loss of antifungal activity against Bd (MIC >200 uM). It promotes probiotic organisms. Updated 7/2021",
