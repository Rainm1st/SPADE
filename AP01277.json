    "Literature": "Mistletoe extracts have immunomodulatory activity by increasing natural killer (NK) cell-mediated killing of tumor cells but spare nontarget cells from NK lysis (Tabiasco et al., 2002).Structure:  It consists of 3 S-S bonds. The arrangement of the cysteine pairing was determined as Cys3-Cys40, Cys4-Cys32 and Cys16-Cys26. In addition to the NMR structure (link), a crystal structure has also been solved with the same fold (Acta Cryst 2003; D59: 2125-32).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.MOA:fungi:  antifungi by membrane targeting and forming channels, the generation of H2O2, and an increase in cytoplasmic free Ca2+. Another six homologs Vt A1, A2, B, C1, 1-PS, and U-PS have been found to date (see subsequent entries). VtA3 is the most cytotoxic while VtB is the least toxic.  Updated 2/2014; 8/2015.",
