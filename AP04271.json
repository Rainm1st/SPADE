    "Literature": "Discovery: homologous search of the BRICHOS domain, cleavage site RR, followed by mature AMP.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (61.9%) toMicaecilinF=C: 20%; R: 15%; V=Y: 10%. GRAVY: 0.845; mol wt: 2561.129; mol formula: C119H171N31O24S4; mol ex coeff: 3230.Activity: active against E. coli ML-35p or ESBL 521/17  (MIC 2-4 uM), A. baumannii 16.63 or 7226/16 (MIC 2-4 uM), P. aeruginosa MDR 522/17 (MIC 2 uM), K. pneumoniae ESBL 344/17  (MIC 2 uM), and S. aureus 1399/17 (MIC 2 uM).Toxicity: human RBC; HC30 >100 uM (less than 20% hemolysis at 100 uM, less hemo.lytic); PBMC (IC50 41.4 uM); A549/K562/NHDF cells (IC50 >100 uM), EA. hy926 (IC50 23.6 uM).MOA:bacteria:E. coli: membrane permeabilization.Structure: became a beta-sheet in micelles esp. SDS (CD 215 nm band), consistent with alpha-fold predicted beta-sheet structure stabilized by two disulfide bonds.",
