    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide shows 33.8% similarity tohBD-3. Mol formula:  C277H457N77O77S6; Mol Wt  6301.509.   GRAVY= -0.36.Structure: CD spectrum with a negative band at 205 nm supports beta-structure.Activity: Active against P. falciparum (IC50 43-49 uM) (ref). The recombinant peptide was active against Gram+ L. monocytogenes ATCC 221633 or 19115 (MIC 25-30 ug/ml), B. subtilis ATCC 6633 (MIC 40 ug/ml), S. aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC 45 ug/ml), Gram- E. coli ATCC 25922 or BNCC 125783 (MIC 10 ug/ml), E. sakazakii ATCC 29544 (MIC 15 ug/ml), and S. typhimurium ATCC 14028 (MIC 15 ug/ml). It can rapidly kill bacteria depending on the concentration treated. It also inhibited biofilm formation (Dong et al., 2022).Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-sensitive:E. coli (~50% activity at 200 mM).Toxicity: little hemo.lytic (1.2%) even at 400 ug/ml (mouse or pig RBC). Not toxic to murine origin RAW264.7 cells and swine origin IPEC-J2 cells (XTT: ~90% alive at 200 ug/ml).AMP significance:   Knockdown of DEFB130 expression in macrophages resulted in a reduced antiplasmodial activity in vitro.Animal model:mouse:  Treating the mice with DEFB130 synthetic peptide resulted in a temporal decrease in parasitemia P. yoelii in vivo,, which can be explained by the number of drug administration.  Thus, DEFB130 might be one of the macrophage effector molecules for eliminating malarial parasites.Immune modulation: it suppressed the LPS-induced expression of NO, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta when the RAW264.7 macrophage cells were treated with recombinant hBD130.Recombinant production:yeast:Pichia pastoris: The recombinant peptide was expressed and purifed.
