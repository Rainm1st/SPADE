Also: inhibit West Nile virus (WNV) replication in primary keratinocytes Showed some toxicity to HEK293T, Human primary keratinocytes and MCF7 at 32 uM.Structure: This peptide is even helical in aqueous solution. With two negative bands at 208 and 222 nm, this peptide is more helical than ModoCath1 with only a minimum at 208 nm.",
