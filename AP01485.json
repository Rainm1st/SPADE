    "Literature": "Contains multiple Tyr.  Peptide-encoding genes induced after D. coniospora infection. Overexpression is associated with greater resistance to fungal infection (Zugasti and Ewbank 2009 Nature Immunol 10: 249-256). In vitro activity has been evaluated in 2021 (Sapkota et al., 2021). Antibacterial activity: MBC: P. aeruginosa PAO1 (<2 uM), P. aeruginosa PA14 (4 uM), E. coli W3110 (8 uM), A. baumanii 17978 (8 uM), S. saprophyticus 15305 (4 uM), E. faecalis 29212 ( 4 uM), S. epidermidis 12228 (16 uM), and S.enterica 700720 (128 uM).\nSalt: MgCl2: 0.1-10 mM 8-16 uM (2 fold). But salt-sensitive to 150 mM or 300 mM NaCl (MBC > 64 uM). pH: 5.5-8.0 (MIC 8-16 uM) 2 fold reduction at pH 5.5-6.5.MOA: CNC-4 localizes intracellularly and directly binds DNA (gel retardation, 8 fold peptide full retarded)Toxicity: not toxic to the mouse derived intestinal cell line MODE-K cells till 100 uM (MTT assays).
