Active against L. monocytogenes (MIC 0.05 uM), L. fleischmannii  (MIC 1 uM), L. grayi  (MIC 2 uM) and L. seeligeri  (MIC 0.5 uM), S. aureus  (MIC 2 uM), and Gram- P. aeruginosa  (MIC 2 uM). It is most potent in this series of defensins. Bacteriostatic effects on S. epidermidis and E. coli. In addition, it completely inhibited the germination of  fungi F. culmorum (IC50 12 uM) and F. graminearum (IC50 2 uM). Found in multiple species. UPdated 7/2021; 6/2022; 2/2024",
