    "Literature": "Activity: Active against Gram+ E. faecium ATCC 19434 (MIC 12.5 uM), S. aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC 25 uM), and MRSA (MIC 12.5 uM), Gram- bacteria E. coli O157 ATCC 43895 (MIC 6.3 uM), S. typhi ATCC 19430 (MIC 12.5 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 including three resistant strains (MIC 6.3-12.5 uM), and fungi C. albicans ATCC 90028 (MIC 6.3 uM), C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019 (MIC 12.5 uM), T. beigelii KCTC 7707 (MIC 6.3 uM), and T. rubrum KCTC 6345 (MIC 6.3 uM).MOA: The peptide caused permeabilization and depolarization of membranes. It induced calcein release from vesicles. It also induced potassium leakage after treatment of E. coli or C. albicans, implying formation of pore at a size 4.8-5.0 nm.Structure: it is random in buffer but helical in membrane-mimetic TFE, SDS, or DPC.Toxicity: not hemo.lytic at 100 uM. Cf. Melittin showed 100% lyss at 12.5 uM. Updated 7/2021",
