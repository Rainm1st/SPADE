  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence  is 75% similar toBrevinin-ALa. Active against S. aureus MTCC 9542 (MIC 12.5 ug/ml), B. coagulans ATCC 7050 (6.25 ug/ml), Gram- E. coli MG1655 10 ug.ml), and V. cholerae (12.5 ug/ml). This peptide is an interesting template for broad activity and poor hemolyis activity.",
