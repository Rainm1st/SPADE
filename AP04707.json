    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (84.21%) toApidaecin IBP: 33%, R=N: 11%.Activity: it inhibited E. coli BL21 (MIC 1-64 uM) in different media RPMI/serum or TSB or LB. Activity in LB < RPMI < TSB. It appears that this Pro-rich peptide is more active in the TSB medium. Warning: Other bacteria not tested.",
