    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is unique and shows only very low similarity (27.32%) tomEar2T: 12%, K: 11%.  GRAVY: -0.606; Mol Wt:  19168.117; mol formula:  C830H1380N226O260S11; mol ex coeff:  6335.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli:  His-tagged pBD129 was expressed in E. coli Origami B (DE3)-pET32a(+) vector and purified via affinity column for this study.Activity: the recombinant protein is active against E. coli DH5alpha (MIC 32 ug/ml),  Streptococcus (MIC 32 ug/ml), pathogenic E.coli K88+ (MIC>512 ug/ml), S.typhimurium CICC14028 (MIC>512 ug/ml), S.aureus CICC23656 (MIC>512 ug/ml), B.subtilis (MIC>512 ug/ml), and P.pastoris X33 (MIC>512 ug/ml).Immune modulation: Also, suppressed LPS-induced  inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNFalpha.Host expression:  E. coli challenge significantly increased its expression in he duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon and an increase in IL-6 and TNFalpha.In vitro toxicity: porcine RBC: not hemo.lytic and not toxic to IPEC-J2 cells till 256 ug/ml.AlphaFold predicted structure:  can be viewedherevia UniProt. The beta fold stabilized by disulfide bonds is located at the N-terminus. Two helical regions are also visible with the large body of the C-terminal region disordered.",
