  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "N-terminal 25 residues were determined by sequencing and the rest were derived from cDNA (Leippe M et al. 1992 EMBO J 11: 3501-3506). Showed sequence homology with NK-lysin.  It is proposed that histidine-mediated dimerization is the molecular switch for pore formation and reveals a novel activation mechanism of pore-forming toxins (JBC 2004; 279: 17834-17841). Structural analysis reveals five helices (H1: 5-18; H2: 25-37; H3: 41-52; H4: 55-62; and H5: 67-74) and 3 S-S bonds (C5-C77, C8-C71, and C35-C46) (Hecht O et al. 2004 JBC 279:17834-41).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.
