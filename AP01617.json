    "Literature": "Discovery: Identified by genome scanning and isolated from an M. corallina cosmid library. NAI-107 production started at 90 h (A stage), reached a maximum at 140 h (D stage) and decreased thereafter(Gallo G et al., 2016).Chemical modification:  Microbisporicin A1 has five thioether rings: S3-C7, T8-C11, S13-C20, S18-C23, and S21-C24. Also, residues T2 and S5 are dehydrated. Unprecedently, Trp4 is chlorinated (5-Cl-) and Pro14 is hydroxylated (3,4-dihydroxylation).Variant: Interestingly, microbisporicin A2 shares the same amino acid sequence with A1 with the only difference being that Pro14 is only monohydroxylated at position 4.SAR: NAI-108 is a bromonated variant of NAI-107. It is obtained by inclusion of KBr in the production medium of either the Actinoallomurus or the Microbispora producer. This is the first brominated lantibiotic, which makes it more potent due to increase in hydrophobicity (Cruz JC et al., 2015).MOA:bacteria: Microbisporicins A1 and A2 displayed similar antibacterial activity by selectively blocking peptidoglycan biosynthesis, leading to cytoplasmic accumulation of the UDP-linked precursor.Structure:  the NMR structure is a non alpha beta structure (Vasile et al., 2012).Animal model:fruit fly:  The Lantibiotic NAI-107 Efficiently Rescues Drosophila melanogaster from Infection with Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) USA300 with an efficacy equivalent to that of vancomycin  (Thomsen et al., 2016).Updated 5/28/2014; 9/2016; 5/2023; 12/2024.",
