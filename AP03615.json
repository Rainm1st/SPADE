    "Literature": "Discovery: isolated neutrophils of the domestic goat.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (55.17%) toOaBac5miniIt corresponds to the N-terminal 22 residue of bactenecin 7.5. P: 36%; R: 55%.Activity: active against E.coli ATCC 25922, ML35p, or M17 (MIC1-2 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, clincla strains (MIC 2 uM), Klebsiella spp. clinical isolate  (MIC 4 uM), A. baumannii clinical isolate (MIC 2 uM), L. monocytogenes EGD (MIC 2 uM), M. luteus CIP A270 (MIC 1 uM), S-aureus ATCC 25923 or 710A or MRSA (MIC > 64 uM), S-intermedius clin. isolate (MIC >64 uM),  C. albicans 820 (MIC 64 uM), and C-parapsilosis (MIC > 64 uM).Toxicity: not hemo.lytic till 100 uM. No toxicity to other mammalian cells tested till 30 uM.Resistance development:yes:bacteria:E. coli MDR 1057: MIC increased after seven passages, indicating the easiness for bacteria to develop resistance. The resistance results from various mutations leading to inactivation of the SbmA transporter.SAR: Ala-scan mutants were made for residues 1 to 8. 1-2 fold activity change was observed for resdues 1-6. However, the R7A analog appeared to be slightly more active (MIC 4 uM) against E. coli. A similar MIC was observed for mini-PF (R20F), min-PL (R18L), and min-PW (R18W and R20W), all are more hydrophobic peptides (but not yer sufficient to stop resistance development). Surprisingly, the P8A analog became 8 fold less active (MIC 64 uM), identifying a critical proline (Bolosov et al., 2023). The 2023 paper was provided by T V Ovchinnikova.",
