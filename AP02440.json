The 3D structure has two antiparallel beta regions and two helical regions (see PDB annotation, Sequence). In addition, there are 6 disulfide bonds: C3-C32; C10-C40; C18-48; C22-C50; C25-C57; and C35-C54 that stabilize this small protein fold.MOA: copsin appears to inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to lipid II.",
