    "Literature": "Activity: Activity against F. graminearum (IC50 1 uM), P. indica and R. solani (IC50 <20 uM). It is induced via the IMD pathway.Chemical modification:  Position T11 is o-glycosylated and important for full activity. Subsequent analysis showed that S7 may also be glycosylated. Turn elements occur near residues 4-7, 10-13, 17, and 18. At modorate concentrations, this peptide, as well as pyrrhocoricin (AP170), is also active against a few  bacteria such as B. megaterium (44% homology to E. coli DnaK D-E helix) and M. luteus, E. coli D31 (MIC 0.5-1.0 uM) (Hoffmann R et al. 1999 Biochim Biophys Acta 1426:459-67).Structure:You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure of Cterminal fragment in complex with E. coli DnaKherein the PDB.MOA:bacteria:  It binds to an internal protein target DnaK (Eur J Biochem 2002; 269: 4226-4237). Note that all D-drosocin is inactive (so a non-membrane target) and the L form kills bacteria in hours not in minutes. Recently, it is demonstrated that this apidaecin-type peptide and its analog Dros (sequence: GKPRPYSPRPTSHPRPIRV) blocks the assembly of the large (50S) subunit of the ribosome, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis (Krizsan A et al., 2015). Substituting Pro at positions 3,5,10, and 14 with a hydroxylated Pro residues improved non-glycosylated drosocin activity against E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Modification of Pro at positions 3 and 5 increased peptide stability in mouse serum.  The new peptides are not toxic to human cells tested at least 600 ug/ml.Updated 12/2012; 12/2015; 4/2018; 4/2019 GW.",
