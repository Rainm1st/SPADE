  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Chemical modification: The N-terminus of the peptide is formylated. leaderless.SAR: Removal of the N-terminal Met had no effect on peptide activity.Activity: This plasmid-encoded peptide is active against food-related L. monocytogenes, S. simulans 22, S. aureus (MRSA), and S. agalactiae, thereby with a potential medical and food preservative use.Peptide stability: It is stable at an extremen acidic environment at high temperature. After 18 hours incubation with trypsin at 37 oC, ~90â€“95% of aureocin A53 remained intact.MOA:bacteria: It causes membrane permeation.Structure: K: 20%; L: 14%; W: 10%. GRAVY: -0.08; M. Wt: 5984.208; Mol Formula: C291H454N67O65S1; Mol Ex coeff: 32220 (5 Trp). A helical conformation (36% by CD)Applied Environ Microbiol 2002. Note taht it is helical in  water.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Toxicity: when purified aureocin A53 (concentration?) was spotted on sheep blood agar plates, no hemolytic activity was detected.The original kalata B1 derivative has been replaced 4/17/2012; 3/2017; 3/2023 GW.",
