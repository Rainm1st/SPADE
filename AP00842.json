  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "SAR:  The peptide became inactive after Trp oxidation or disulfide bond reduction. Segment 18-43 is active. The recombinant form contains 4 more residues (AMDP) at the N-terminus. Single-residue mutants of DvnRV41 were found to be less active than DvnRV41 (Rihakova J et al. 2009).Chemical modification: the peptide lost activity when S-S bonds were disrupted (XXR); oxidation of even one Trp made peptide inactive. peptide retained activity after acetylation. succinylated DV41 was inactive; the peptide lost activity only when all the three tyrosines are nitrated (Bhugaloo-Vial et al., 1999).Structure:  CD studies suggest that the peptide is primarily unordered in phosphate butter, in DPC, or in 80% TFE.Updated 3/2014; 9/2021.",
