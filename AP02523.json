    "Literature": "The sequence of this entry is 37.9% SIMILAR TOplant Tu-AMP 1. There are four disulfide bonds: 3-32, 7-28, 16-38, and 31-49.Activity: Active again yeasts S. cerevisiae, C. albicans, C. tropicalis and K. marxianus.  It also inhibited the alpha-amylase activities from  C. maculatus and human saliva in vitro. This peptide S3 has an identical sequence to PSI-1.2 initially identified as serine proteinase inhibitor that inhibits both trypsin and chymotrypsin (Antcheva N et al., 2001). Also refer to UniProKB:P83241.",
