    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (96.77%) toAnisaxin-2SMol formula: C153H261N45O41, Mol Wt: 3397.996; Mol Ex Coeff: 11100; GRAVY:  -0.558.Activity: Active against E. coli ATCC, c.i., or c.i.2 (MIC 0.5-2 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC, c.i., c.i.2 (MIC 0.5-2 uM), A. baumannii ATCC, c.i., or c.i.2. (MIC 0.5-1 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC, c.i., or c.i.2 (MIC 4-16 uM), and S. aureus ATCC (MIC 32-64 uM), S-aureus c.i., or c.i.2 (MIC >64 uM). All MBC values are similar to MIC values, indicative of a bactericidal effect.Toxicity:  the concentration that reduced 50% viability of HPBMC >100 uM.  NO vidence for DNA damage.Structure:  the peptide (20 uM) became helical in 50% TFE or 10 mM SDS based on CD studies.",
