    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 38.7% similarity toMyticalin C9.  Intially designed as an anticancer peptide (Heulot M et al., 2016), this peptide contains the TAT moiety corresponds to amino acids 48–57 of the HIV TAT protein (RRRQRRKKRG) + a GG linker + the RasGAP317–326 moiety corresponds to amino acids 317–326 of the human RasGAP protein (DTRLNTVWMW).Activity: This designed anticancer peptide also shows antimicorbial activity against  E. coli (MIC 11-23 uM), A. baumannii (MIC 2.9 uM), S. aureus (MIC 46 uM or >), E. faecium (MIC 23 uM), L. monocytogenes (MIC 46 uM), S. maltophilia (MIC 6 uM), S. pyogenes (MIC 2.9 uM), S. typhimurium (MIC 23 uM), and P. aeruginosa (MIC 23-46 uM).MOA:cancer: WMW is necessary and sufficient to sensitize cancer cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis and to reduce cell migration (Barras et al., 2016).Resistance development:yes:bacteria:E. coli: E. coli developed extensive resistance to this peptide after 20 passages.Resistance mechanism: Mutations in the essential outer membrane protein BamA to reduce electrostatic interactions contribute to E. coli resistance (Georgieva et al., 2024).Animal model:mouse:  In vivo experiments revealed that TAT-RasGAP317-326 protects mice from lethal E. coli-induced peritonitis if administrated locally at the onset of infection, but not when the treatment was delayed.Updated 7/2021; 11/2024",
