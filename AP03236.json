    "Literature": "Discovery: This peptide was obtained from a combination use of database and structure refinement.Structure: Different from horine, which has a classic horizontal amphipathic helical structure, verine is proposed to possess a vertical amphipathic structure.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure of the parent moleculeherein the PDB.Activity: While horine is mainly active against Gram+ pathogens, verine is active against both Gram+ and Gram- pathogens,  E. faecium V286-17 (MIC 2 uM) anti-VRE, S. aureus USA300 LAC MRSA and 30 clinical strains (MIC 2-8 uM), K. pneumoniae E406-17 and 22 clinical strains (MIC 4-32 uM), A. baumannii B28-16 (MIC 8 uM), P. aeruginosa E411-17 (4-8 uM), and E. coli E423-17 (MIC 2 uM).MOA:bacteria: it permeabilized S. aureus membranes (also D=L).Resistance development:no:bacteria:S. aureus USA300: S. aureus USA300 LAC did not develop resistance to verine during a multiple passage experiment.Half-life in vitro:plasma:human:  half life is 15 min.In vitro toxicity: very low hemo.lytic hRBC (HC50 >200 uM), other cytotoxicity: human hepatic progenitor liver cell (HepaRG (LC50 >80 uM), human kidney HEK293 (LC50 >80 uM), human lung fibroblasts (MRC9) (LC50>25 uM), and mouse splenocytes (LC50 >12.5 uM).Animal model:mouse: neutropenic, systemic: verine protects animals from death caused by either MRSA or klebsiella. It reduces K. pneumoniae burden in kidney, liver, spleen, and lung when injected either intraperitoneally (i.p./i.p.) or intravenously (i.p./i.v.).Peptide formulation: nanofiber formulated peptide displayed antibiofilm activity in wound model:mouse (Su et al., 2020;Su et al., 2021;Su et al., 2023;John et al., 2023).Synergy:antibody:  Microneedle Patches Co-delivering Monoclonal Antibodies and W379 Effectively Eradicated Wound Biofilms (Su et al., 2024).Patent: published.Updated 6/2022; 8/2023; 12/2023; 2/2024; 11/2024",
