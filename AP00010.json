  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: active against E. coli ATCC 25922 or ML-35 (MIC 1 uM), S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028 (MIC 1 uM), S. marcescens ATCC8100 (MIC 1 uM), S.aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC >128 uM). Active against S. enterica serovar typhimurium LT2 or ATCC 14028 (MIC 12-25 ug/ml), K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883(MIC 12 ug/ml), E. cloacae ATCC 13047 (MIC 25 ug/ml) and P. aeruginosa ATCC 7700(MIC 50 ug/ml). (Mueller-Hinton broth)(provided by Chunfeng Wang).Sequence analysis: Rich in P (46.7%) and R (28.3%).SAR: Bac7(1-35) has antibacterial activity similar to bac7. Also, Bac7(1–16) was an equally potent inhibitor as Bac7(1–35), consistent with the similar MICs observed for these two derivatives. However, the N-terminal arginine pair is needed for efficient uptake (Guida et al., 2015).MOA:  At ~MIC, the fragment binds to internal targets via stereospecific uptake (because all-D-enantiomer failed to be taken in and much less active L>D); at higher concentrations, it works via non-specific membranolytic mechanism. Bac(1-16) is still active against E. coli and S. enterica but kinetically deficient compared to bac(1-35). Bac(5-35) is much less active, indicating the importance of the N-terminal segment (Biochim Biophys Acta 2006; 1760: 1732-1740). Bac7 fragments are indepedently listed in 2023.
