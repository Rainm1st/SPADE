    "Literature": "Host expression:  mouse PMC produce antimicrobial peptide beta-defensin-2 (mBD-2). Treatment of PMCs with staphylococcal PGN, a gram-positive bacterial cell wall component and a TLR-2 agonist, resulted in a significant increase in TLR-2 and mBD-2 expression. In addition, PGN-induced mBD-2 expression was attenuated by SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, underlining the importance of p38 MAPK in mBD-2 induction.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide shows 41.9% similarity toCycloviolacin O5.Activity: PGN-activated PMC-derived mBD-2 significantly killed S. aureus, and mBD-2-neutralizing antibodies blunted this antimicrobial activity.
