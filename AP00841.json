  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Also, bacteriocin N15 was isolated from nuka (Japanese rice-bran paste), which is utilized as starter in the fermenting of vegetables (Losteinkit et al., 2001). It has the same sequence as enterocin A.Activity: This bacteriocin showed activity against  L. sake JCM1157 at a concentration of 40 AU/ml, E. faecium JCM8714, 8715, 8726, E. gallinarum JCM8728,B. circulans JCM2504, L. monocytogenes.Antimicrobial robustness: This peptide is resistant to heat treatment at 100oC for 2 h, but lost activity after autoclaving at 121oC for 15 min. It is active between pH 2 to 10, making it a possible useful candidate for food preservative.  Updated 7/2019; 9/2021; 12/2022",
