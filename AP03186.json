  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "This is a novel sequence as APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (40%) toPhylloseptin-O2.Chemical modification: Thioether bonds between S1 and C5, and T18 and C23. In addition, C23 is dehydrated to form a double bond between Calpha and carbonyl carbons. There are likely multiple D-amiino acids. N-terminally motified, S2, T6 dehydrated, Y8 is O-glycosylated, S10, S12, S14, and S16 became D-alanines.Activity: Active against S. simulans 22 (MIC 0.11 uM), S. aureus SG511 or SG511 DapR or clinical isolate MRSA MB5393 (MIC 0.22-13.6 uM), M. tuberculosis H37Ra (MIC 13.6 uM),  B. subtilis 168  (MIC 3.4 uM), clinical isolates C. difficile RyC 11872343 toxigenic (MIC 3.4 uM), C. difficile RyC 11945271 toxigenic (1.7 uM).MOA:bacteria:  Lipid II binding as the most plausible mechanism of action.",
