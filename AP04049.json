    "Literature": "Discovery: Screening of a P. glauca EST database using a known PgD1 sequences.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (64%) toMtDef4C: 16%. GRAVY: -0.716; mol Wt: 5729.61; mol formula: C237H375N73O73S9; mol ex coeff: 1990.Activity:  inhibited the fungal growth V. dahliae (IC50 2 ug/ml), B. cinerea (IC50 4 ug/ml), and F. oxysporum (IC50 11 ug/ml). Completely inhibited spores of V. dahliae at 8 ug/ml.Peptide stability: recombinant peptide retained 61% activity after 30 min treatment at 100oC.Antimicrobial robustness: KCl-insensitive:V. dahliae (50 mM); CaCl2-sensitive:V. dahliae (5 mM);MOA:fungi: permeabilized membranes of these fungi, including S. cerevisiae but not C-albicans at 50 ug/ml.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: expressed in the strain BL21 (Origami pLys S) DE3, affinity Ni2+ column, SUMO-tag protease removed.
