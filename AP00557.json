    "Literature": "Activity: Active against Gram- E. coli ATCC 25922 or O157:H7 or PCN033 or RS218 (MIC 0.80-10 uM), S. typhimurium ATCC 14028 or 700408 (MIC 0.40-0.80 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883 (MIC 0.4 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 3.18 uM), Gram+ L. monocytogenes ATCC 19115 (MIC 0.80 uM), S. aureus ATCC 25923 or BAA-39 or 43300 MRSA (MIC 0.40-0.8 uM).Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-insensitive:E. coli (100 mM); NaCl-insensitive:P. aeruginosa (100 mM); NaCl-insensitive:S. typhimurium (100 mM);NaCl-insensitive:K. pneumoniae (100 mM); NaCl-insensitive:S. aureus (100 mM); NaCl-insensitive:L. monocytogenes (100 mM);Structure: it is not all helical; the helix is not continual in 50% TFE.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Stability:  Fowlicidin(6-26)-NH2 retained antibacterial activity for 2h in serum.Animal model:mouse:bacteria: It increased mice survival by 50% from a lethal dose of MRSA.Anti-inflammatory:This truncated peptide also reduced TNF-alpha and NO production in macrophage by 77% and 96%, respectively (i.e., anti-inflammatory). Thus, this fragment may have therapeutic potential for drug-resistant bacterial infection as well as sepsis (Bommineni et al 2010 Peptides 31: 1225).11/2017; 6/2018; 4/2024; 9/2024.",
