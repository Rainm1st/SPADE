  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: Initially found in 1999.Activity: LTP110 inhibited the germination of P. oryzae spores, and its inhibitory activity decreased in the presence of a divalent cation (salt-sensitive). At 27 ug/ml, strongly inhibited the spore germination of fungal P. oryzae, which causes rice blast in the field. Salt-sensitive: Calcium (1 mM) drastically compromised its activity. It also showed concentration-depdendent inhibition of X. oryzae (27-133 ug/ml), whic causes blight disease in rice. It completely inhibited P. syringgae (MIC 27 ug/ml). Overall, the antibacterial activity of LTP110 is weaker than antifungal activity.Toxicity:  no significant effect on Chinese hamster ovarian cells when added to the culturing media.
