GRAVY: 0.035; mol wt: 3502.196; mol formula: C146H247N41O45S6; mol ex coeff: 1865. Another different defensin, also called Ds-defensin, was previously reported in 2015 (see AP2592).Activity: active against Gram+ S. aureus ATCC25923 (MIC 50 uM), S. carnosus (MIC 25 uM), E-faecalis (MIC>50 uM), Gram- E-coli ATCC25922 (MIC > 50 uM), P. faecalis (MIC 25 uM), and fungi C-albicans ATCC10231 (MIC > 50 uM) and C-neoformans (MIC> 50 uM). Also showed potent antioxidant activity.",
