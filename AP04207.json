    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (91.67%) toAS-12obtained by sequence substitution of AS-12. K: 42%; I=F: 17%.Activity: active against E. coli ATCC 25922 or 4 clinical strains (MIC 8-16 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 or 4 clinical strrains (MIC 4-8 ug/ml),  K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883 (MIC 8-64 ug/ml), A. baumannii (MIC 16 ug/ml), Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 29213 (MIC 4 ug/ml), MRSA (MIC 8 ug/ml), S. epidermidis (MIC 4 ug/ml), and C.albicans (MIC 16 ug/ml) or ATCC 10231 >128 ug/ml.It also showed anti-inflammatory effect (IL-6 and TNF-alpha decreased in  RAW264.7 cells) induced by LPS.MOA:bacteria:E. coli: acted on membranes. ROS detected.Animal model:mouse: P. aeruginosa sepsis: dose-dependent efficacy (22.2% to 77.8% survival) was observed (IP treatment 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg).",
