  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (75%) toKR-12K: 33%, I: 17%, R: 25%.Activity:  active against Gram- E. coli KCTC 1682 (MIC 2 uM), P. aeruginosa KCTC 1637 (MIC 8 uM), S. typhimurium KCTC 1926 (MIC 2 uM), Gram+ B. subtilis KCTC 3068 (MIC 2 uM), S. epidermidis KCTC 1917 (MIC 1 uM), and S. aureus KCTC 1621 (MIC 2 uM) (see ref). Also yeast C. albicans KCTC 7219 (MIC 12.8 ug/ml) (ref new). Warning: Non-standard assay.The peptide can also bind to LPS and show an anti-inflammatory effect (e.g., suppressing TNF-alpha).In vitro toxicity: human RBC (HC50 >800 uM), not hemo.lytic. not toxic to RAW264.7 cells at 128 ug/ml.Structure:  random coil in 10 mM PBS and helical in 0.1% LPS.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.",
