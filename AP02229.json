    "Literature": "Activity: Active against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria as well as mammalian cells (a toxin). This protein has a unique fold. The 3D structure consists of  four alpha-helices (residues 7-24, 32–36, 42–47 and 54–58) connected by three loop regions and stabilized by five disulfide bridges: Cys5-Cys42, Cys13-Cys45, Cys24-Cys31, Cys47-Cys55 and Cys51-Cys61. Inactive dimer forms at pH 8 via deprotonation of His50 and His59. A pH-dependent trigger generates the active monomer form. The oligomerization state of the amoebic protein to form a pore (~0.5 nm) is virtually independent of the protein-to-lipid ratio, it may be assumed that acanthaporin functions by a barrel-stave mechanism in membranes.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.
