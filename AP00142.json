    "Literature": "This peptide was de novo designed based on the frequently occurring amino acid residues (Gly, Lue, and Lys) found in a defined group of AMPs such as those from amphibians (see the reference). It displayed anti-E. coli activity similar to human LL-37. Based on the knowledge derived from this database, conversion of all lysines to arginines conferred HIV inhibitory activity to the mutant peptide GLR-19 (Wang G et al. 2010 Antimicrob. Agents Chemother 54: 1343-1346). Replaced 7/2010.",
