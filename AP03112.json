    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (73%) todatabase designed peptide DFTamP1.Activity: Active against MRSA, S. aureus USA300 LAC (MIC 3.1 uM), S. aureus M838-17 , E. faecium V286-17 (MIC 3.1-6.2 uM) anti-VRE, not active against the Gram- bacteria tested P.aeruginosa E411-17, K.pneumoniae E406-17, E.coli ampC, and E.coli E423-17 (MIC >50 uM and won't be acitve till 100 uM). Killing kinetics (D=L). It can also disrupted preformed biofilms:S. aureus.Antimicrobial robustness: The antibacterial activity of DFT503 is NaCl-insensitive:S. aureus (200 mM NaCl); CaCl2-insensitive:S. aureus (1-2 mM Ca2+).MOA:bacteria:S. aureus: it acted on membranes.  The D-form depolarized bacterial membanes better than the L-form.Structure: SDS-bound structure was determined.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Animal model:mouse:  In the series of localized sequence shuffled peptides, DFT503 showed systemic in vivo efficacy (i.p./i.p.) similar to DFT561 optimized in vitro. A better effect can be seen after two treatments at 2 and 24 h post infection. Updated 7/2021; 12/2023; 8/2024",
