    "Literature": "Activity: Active against E. coli (MIC 6 uM) and S. aureus (MIC 3 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 13 uM), E. cloacae (MIC 6 uM), K. pneumoniae (MIC 6 uM), S. epidermidis (MIC 6 uM), Streptococcus Group B (MIC 6 uM), E. faecalis (MIC 50 uM), and C. albicans (MIC 25 uM).  Also active against MRSA USA300 (MIC 3.1 uM) (Menousek J et al 2012 Int J Antimicrob Agents 39:402).  The peptide also inhibited Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 HIV-1 (EC50 1.2 uM).Toxicity:  hemolytic HC50 50 uM. TC50 2.9 uM in CEM-SS cells(Wang G et al. 2010 Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 54: 1343-1346).Structure:  CD was measured in the presence and absence of TFE.SAR:  A change of residue 18 to K18 led to an improved TI (Chem Bio Drug Des 2008; 72: 58-64).Peptide engineering: Stapled peptides based on ascaphin-8 (e.g., A8-2-o and A8-4-Dp) has been made via thiol-halogen click chemistry to improve peptide stability and antitumor activity. The bridges differ from the classic hydrocarbon staple in that two cysteines are introduced to facilitate the bridge formation (Kong et al., 2023). Updated 5/2020; 12/2023; 5/2024",
