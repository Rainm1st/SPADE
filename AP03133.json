    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (84.6%) toDermaseptin-B5. A 20%, K 16%, GRAVY 0.18; Mol Wt 2606.073; Mol form: C118H195N30O33S1, Mol Ex. Coeff 5550.Structure: helical in TFE (50%)(CD).Activity:  Broad spectrum, active against  S. aureus NCTC 10788 (MIC 16 uM), MRSA NCTC 12493 (MIC 32 uM), E. faecalis NCTC 12697 (MIC 16 uM), Gram- E. coli NCTC 10418 (MIC 8 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 16 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC 43816 (MIC 8 uM), and C. albicans NCYC 1467 (MIC 64 uM). MBC is usually 2 fold higher than MIC.SAR: After changing residues 8 and 23 to K, the peptide became more helical,  and more active (MIC 2-4) against the above microorganisms. MBIC (minimal biofilm inhibitory concentration) 8-32 against E. coli and MRSA.Toxicity:  Low hemo.lytic activity (HC50) 128-256 uM. Edited 7/2021; 12/2024",
