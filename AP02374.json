    "Literature": "Activity: Active against reference strains S. aureus and S. epidermidis (MIC 8-16 uM), E. faecalis, C. albicans (MIC 62.5 uM), A. baumannii clinical isolates (NM8, NM35, and NM75) (MIC 62.5 uM), S. maltophilia clinical isolates (B32/1 B32/4 U8908 B5/5 B6/2) (MIC 31-62 uM). Active against plant pathogens X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria  (MIC 3.1-6.2 uM) (CamÃ³ C et al. 2018).  Showed a poor hemolysis of human erythrocytes (LC50 >160 uM).  Also active against non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells (LC50 80 uM). It is propsoed that this peptide has proinflammatory action and promotes cytotoxic capability of NK cells on 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma cells (Pantic et al., 2017). Updated 5/2017.",
