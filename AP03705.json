    "Literature": "AMP Significance: a 2023 Science paper reveals that Peptide YY, a Paneth cell antimicrobial peptide, maintains Candida gut commensalism.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (94.44%) toHuman peptide YYActivity: Remarkably, it displayed selective antifungal activity against virulent C. albicans hyphae-but not the yeast form.MOA:fungi: PC-PYY is a cationic molecule that interacts with the anionic surfaces of fungal hyphae to cause membrane disruption (D=L) and transcriptional reprogramming that selects for the yeast phenotype.",
