    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (56.4%) todog K9CATHR: 27%, L: 14%, G: 11%. GRAVY: -1.068; M Wt: 4450.32; mol formula: C190H349N73O48; mol ex coeff: 0.Activity:  Active against Gram- E. coli ATCC25922 (MIC 3.125 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC27853 (MIC 3.125 uM), Gram+ bacteria S-aureus ATCC6538 (MIC > 50 uM), P. acnes ATCC6919 (MIC 1.562 uM), B. subtilis CMCC63501 (MIC 3.125 uM), fungi C-albicans SC5314 (MIC > 50 uM).MOA:bacteria:E. coli: permeated the membranes.Structure: random coil in water and helical in LPS or SDS. Both NaCl (up to 400 mM) and temperature (up to 90oC) had no effect on the strucutre. This peptide has a sequence very similar to human cathelicidin LL-37 (40.5%) but rich in arginine.  As a consequence, the alpha-fold predicted structure is also almost identical to that of LL-37 initially determined by 3D NMR spectroscopy (Wang, 2008).  hence, this entry is very likely a natural AMP.Animal model:mouse: Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and LPS-induced (25 mg/kg) sepsis model; peptide treatment increased mice survival (i.p./i.p., dose-dependent 2.5-10 mg/kg) and showed an anti-inflammatroy effect as well by reducing TNF-alpha and IL-6.",
