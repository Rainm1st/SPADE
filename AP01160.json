  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: Isolated initially from a West Africa plant as a sweet protein (Ming and Hellekant 1994 FEBS Lett 355: 106-108).Chemical modification:  There are 4 S-S bonds: C4-C52, C16-C37, C22-C47, and C26-C49 (Kohmura et al. 1996 Biopolymers 38: 553-6).Structure:  The protein contains one helix and 3 beta-strands (Nat Struct Biol 1998; 5: 427-31). A refined structure is also available in the PDB.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Activity: Only very recently was antimicrobial property predicted based on the gamma-core motif and verified experimentally. Diffusion zone: Active against C. albicans (pH 7.5>pH 5.5).  Only at pH 7.5, active against S. aureus, B. subtilis, E. coli.updated 1/16/2010; 2/2014; Jan2025.",
