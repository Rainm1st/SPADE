  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is 93.33% similar toYRA 15–13R: 40%, L: 27%, I=A: 13%.Activity: Active against Gram- P. aeruginosa ATCC 25,668 (MIC 2.5 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27,853 (MIC 1.25 uM), A. baumannii ATCC 1605 (MIC 10 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC 27,736 (MIC 80 uM), and Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 29,213 (MIC 10 uM).MOA: leakage in liposomes, likely membrane targeting.Structure:  partially helical in anionic liposomes.In vitro toxicity: human RBC: not hemol.lytic at 100 uM. Low cytotoxicity (60-80% survival) to THP-1 and BV-2 cells.Peptide stability: Unlike LL-37, it is resistant to V8 protease and elastase but can be degraded by proteinase K.Animal model:mouse: substantially reduced P. aeruginosa burden in the mouse burn wound after 24 or 48 h comparable to colistin.Deposited and provided by Manjul Lata Jan2025.",
