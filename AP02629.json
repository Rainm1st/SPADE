    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide most resembles (46.7% similarity)Chicken CATH-3. Mol Wt: 2623.235; mol formula:C127H204N38O23; GRAVY: -0.53. Helical in SDS. The peptide exhibited  activity against all bacteria tested (MIC 2-8 uM).  These include Gram- bacteria E. coli ATCC25922, S. typhimurium ATCC14028, S. pullorum C79-13, Gram+ S. aureus ATCC29213, S. epidermidis ATCC12228, E. faecalis ATCC29212, and B. subtilis CMCC63501. Hemolysis: the peptide displayed 50% hemolysis at 20 uM (no serum) and 32 uM in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum (FBS). Two fragments dCATH(1-16) and dCATH(5-20) showed broad activity against both Gram+ and Gram- pathogens (MIC 2-8 uM) in the presence of physiolocal concentrations of salts. These fragments are less toxic. A change of W4 to A, or W17 to A substantially reduced peptide activities. The fragments bind LPS and suppress the release of TNFalpha, IL-6, and NO from RAW 264.7 cells, implying an anti-inflammatory effect (Feng et al., 2020). Updated 5/2020; source 10/2022",
