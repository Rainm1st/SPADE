  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: This is a unique sequence since APD analysis reveals a poor similarity (28.2%) toCod cathelicidin.  Mol. Wt: 12054.319; GRAVY=-0.64. This is a multiple-domain antimicorbial protein: an N-terminal Ser-rich region, a Pro-rich region (PRR), and a Cys-rich region (CRR).  The Ser-rich domain made the entire protein Ser-rich (31%) and distinguishes it from the rest penaeidins that lack this domain. No antibacterial activity was detected for the PRR and CRR domains.Activity: MjPen-II binds to bacterial surface polysaccharides to promote bacterial agglutination (bacteria-agglutinating). The Ser-rich region enhances the agglutination activity of MjPen-II, but had no agglutination activity by itself.  Antibacterial: Active against Gram- E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, V. anguillarum, Gram+ B. megaterium, B. subtilis, S. aureus. Updated 12/2016.",
