    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (97.67%) toOaBac5A variant of OaBac5 (isolated and tested). P: 47%; R: 23%; F: 14%.  GRAVY: -0.80; M. Wt.: 5127.282; Mol formula: C251H383N73O44; Mol Ex Coeff: 0.Activity: Active against E. coli 0157:H7 (MIC 6 ug/ml),  S. aureus 1056 MRSA (MIC 10 ug/ml), and C. albicans 3153A (MIC 45 ug/ml).antimicrobial robustness: in 100 mM NaCl, the peptide lost activity against MRSA, its activity against Escherichia coli was reduced to MIC 22 ug/ml, but there was little change against Candida. The original has been replaced due to poor antimicrobial activity Updated 5/2023.",
