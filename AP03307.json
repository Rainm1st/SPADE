Wt: 2010.402, and Mol ex coeff.: 5550.Structure: 53.64% helical in 50% TFE.Activity:  inhibits S. aureus ATCC 6538 or MRSA NCTC 12493 (MIC 8-16 uM), E.faecalis NCTC 12697 (MIC 128 uM), E. coli ATCC 8739 (MIC 2 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC 43816 (MIC 8 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027 (MIC 16 uM), C. albicans ATCC 10231 (MIC 64 uM). MBCs are similar or 2-fold higher. At 2 MIC, the peptide killed E. coli and S. aureus in 60 min. Antibiofilms of most of these bacteria as well. Also, this peptide has anti-proliferation of cancer cells, including  PC-3, H838, H157 and U251MG (IC50 10.2-34.25 uM).MOA:bacteria:E. coli:  It permeabilized the membranes of both E. coli and MOA:bacteria:S. aureus.Resistance development:no:bacteria:E. coli: multiple passage: After 12 cycles, E. coli didn't develop resistance to the peptide.In vitro toxicity:  it also influences normal cells HMEC-1 (IC50 29.85 uM) but not HaCaT (IC50 175.6 uM).
