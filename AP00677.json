  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "A homodimer via S-S bond. Its antibacterial activity is not affected by 150 mM NaCl. The S-pyridyl ethylated monomer showed comparable activity, but the dimer is 2-fold better in binding LPS (Okuda D et al. 2006 Antimicrob Agents Chemother 50:2602). While the C-terminal residues 34-43 are unimportant for activity, the N-terminal 18 residues showed potent antimicrobial activity but reduced LPS binding.",
