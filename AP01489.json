  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Contains multiple Tyr.  Normally, this AMP is expressed at a low level, but its expression is increased by Drechmeria coniospora infection (or by physical injury and by osmotic stress). For infection and wounding, the induction is dependent on a p38 MAP kinase cascade, but for osmotic stress, this pathway is not required. A pathway involving fatty acid synthesis and the evolutionary conserved wnk?1 and gck?3/Ste20/GCK?VI kinases modulates nlp?29 expression in the Caenorhabditis elegans epidermis, independently of p38 MAPK signaling. Therefore, the control of the antimicrobial peptide gene nlp-29 links fatty acid metabolism, osmoregulation, maintenance of epidermal integrity and the innate immune response to infection (Virulence. 2010 Dec 22;1(3):113-122).AMP significance and sleep: NLP-29 acts through the neuropeptide receptor NPR-12 in locomotion-controlling neurons that are presynaptic to RIS and that depolarize this neuron to induce sleep (Sinner et al., 2021).
