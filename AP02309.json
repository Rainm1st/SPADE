    "Literature": "Activity: Active against a broad spectrum of pathogens, including multiple S. aureus, S. epidermidis, A. baumannii strains, E. coli ATCC 25726, S. maltophilia (MIC 0.6-5 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 (MIC 10 uM), E. faecalis ATCC 29212,  P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 20 uM), and weakly against C. albicans (MIC 80 uM). Also active  against human non-small lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells, and colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells.Toxicity:  Its applications as antibacterial and anticancer agents may be limited due to hemolytic ability. However, the D9K mutant is not hemolytic.Structure:  In TFE, residues 6-17 and 21-28 are helical (Serra et al. 2014). Reg. 09/23/2014.",
