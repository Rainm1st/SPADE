    "Literature": "Activity: Recombinantly expressed peptide is active against E. coli.  Refer to AP1315 reference for additional activity assays using synthetic hBD-27.Warning: It was found the synthetic form was inactive against 5 bacteria. More studies are needed to clarify its antimicrobial activity. It is proposed that the peptides encoded by DEFB23, DEFB27, and DEFB29 genes exert physiological functions in the male genital tract, which may not be related to bacterial inhibition in host defense (der Naturwissenschaften, 2003).Replaced 2007.
