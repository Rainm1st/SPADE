  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "The sequence may be incomplete. Curvaticin L442 is active at pH values between 4.0 and 9.0 and it retains activity even after incubation for 5 min at 121 degrees C with 1 atm of overpressure. Proteolytic enzymes and alpha-amylase inactivated this curvaticin, while the effect of lipase was not severe.",
