Wt: 4054.873, and Mol ex coeff.: 1865.Activity:  both deffusion and microdilution methods were used. Active against E. coli (MIC 30-60 ug/ml) and S. aureus (MIC 15-30 ug/ml) but not Salmonella spp. (MIC > 100 ug/ml). Warning: activity was tested using the TRX fusion peptide (TRX protein itself was inactive).",
