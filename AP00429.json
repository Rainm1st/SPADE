    "Literature": "Highly active against E. coli and B. megaterium and moderately active against A. calcoaceticus and S. pyogenes.  The peptide showed a marked lytic activity against an NK-sensitive mouse tumour cell line, YAC-1, but it did not lyse red blood cells. This porcine AMP contains 3 disulfide bonds and 5 helices (NMR by Liepinsh E et al. Nat Struct Biol 1997;  4: 793).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. NK-2, the antimicrobial core region corresponding to residues K39-K65, was found to possesses antibacterial and antifungal activities (C. albicans) but poor toxicity to human cells (Antimicrob Agents Chemother 47: 607-13, 2003). NK-2 kills intraerythrocytic P. falciparum (Antimicrob. Agents Chermother. 52: 1713-1720 (2008). NK-2 also binds to LPS. NK-18 (KILRGVCKKIMRTFLRRI-amide, 18 aa, residues 39-57) possesses potent antitumor activity against bladder and prostate cancer cells by disrupting the integrity of cell membrane (helical in 50% TFE, CD) (Yan et al., 2012).
