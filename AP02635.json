  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide most resembles (36.4% similarity)human CCL20.  Induced due to bacterial or viral infection. The SC7C8R pair is highly conserved for chemokine activity. At 3, 5, and 7 dpi (24 and 48 hip for bacteria E. tarda), the viral amounts (megalocytivirus) in fish administered with rCsCCL17 were significantly lower than those in controls and the fish administered with rCsCCL17M (a CC to SS mutant).",
