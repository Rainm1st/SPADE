  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "PvD1 inhibited the growth of the yeasts, C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. guilliermondii, K. marxiannus and S. cerevisiae. PvD1 also presented an inhibitory activity against the growth of phytopathogenic fungi including F. oxysporum, F. solani, F. lateritium and R. solani. Its activity involves membrane permeabilization, inhibition of medium acifification, and induction of ROS in fungi cells (Curr Microbiol. 2010 Dec 19. 62: 1209-1217).",
