    "Literature": "DiscoveryThe peptide was also discovered byMahoney M et al.in the same year.Activity: Active against E. coli ATCC 25922 or ML-35 or D21 (MIC 0.12-0.25 uM), S. enterica serovar typhimurium ATCC 14028 (MIC 0.25 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 or 2 clinical isolates (MIC 0.25-2.0 uM),  S. marcescens ATCC 8100 (MIC 0.25 uM), P-vulgaris ATCC 13315 (MIC>80 uM), S. aureus ATCC 25923 or Cowan 1 MRSA clinical isolate (MIC 0.5-1.0 uM), S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC 0.25 uM), E. faecalis ATCC 29212 or VREF clinical isolate (MIC 1 uM), B. megaterium Bm11 (MIC 0.25 uM), C. albicans clinical isolate (MIC 4 uM), C. neoformans 3 clinical isolates (MIC 1.0 uM), and R. rubra (MIC 0.5 uM) (Skerlavaj  et al., 1999). It also inhibit B. anthracis (MIC 8 ug/ml) (Blower et al., 2018). Also inhibited human Rhinovirus 1B (HRV1B) (Sousa et al., 2017).  In the synthetic peptide used for activity assays, the last Gly residue was converted to NH2 (more precisely, SMAP-28).SAR:  Removal of the C-terminal residues 18-28 or changing residues 22,25, and 26 to K disrupted hemolytic activity of the peptide (Shin et al 2001 BBRC 285: 1046).Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-insensitive:E. coli (100 mM); NaCl-insensitive:P. aeruginosa (100 mM); NaCl-insensitive:S. typhimurium (100 mM);NaCl-insensitive:K. pneumoniae (100 mM); NaCl-insensitive:S. aureus (100 mM); NaCl-insensitive:L. monocytogenes (100 mM) (ref: AP557);MOA:bacteria:E. coli:  membrane targeting. However, it targets the outer membrane protein I (OprI) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Lin et al., 2010). For another peptide working in a similar way, see the APD entry 431.Structure: In membrane-mimetic TFE, residues 8-17 are helical, residues 18-19 serves as a hinge, and residues 20-28 are ordered (Tack BF et al. 2002 Eur J Biochem 269: 1181).  You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Surface immobilized peptide: The peptide has been immobilized to superparamagnetic beads and glass with antimicorbial activity (Soares et al., 2015).Template-based design:Ovispirin-1 (KNLRRIIRKIIHIIKKYG) was designed based on SMAP-29. Ovispirin-1 (OV-1) is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptide similar to SMAP-29. OV-2 and OV-3 are shortened or mutated versions of OV-1 (Saiman L et al 2001 Antimicrob Agent Chemother. 45: 2838-44).  However, novispirin, obtained by changing residue I10 of OV-1 to G10, can kill bacteria rapidly but is relatively nontoxic to human cells (Sawai MV et al 2002 Protein Engineering 15: 225-232). Novicidin (seq: KNLRRIIRKGIHIIKKYF) is another derivative of OV-1.Updated 8/2010; 6/2018; 4/2024; 8/2024",
