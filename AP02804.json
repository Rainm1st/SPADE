  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide shows 33.8% similarity toHipposin.Activity: Active against an indicator strain M. luteus (MIC 4.5 uM).SAR:  A synthetic fragment corresponding to the N-terminal 38 residues (H2A 2-39) was found to be active (MIC 0.5-1 uM).Note that a mikxture of H2B and H4 was active at 3 uM and a fragment of H1 was also active. Additional studies will clarifiy whether the activity can be attributed to the peptide or protein. Future studies will also clarify whether these histones play a role in innate defense against shrimp pathogens.",
