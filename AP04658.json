    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (85.29%) toBF-CATHK: 38%, F: 15%, I: 12%. GRAVY: -0.653; Mol Wt: 4217.38; mol formula: C207H352N56O37; mol ex coeff: 0.Activity: active against E. coli 11 isolates (MIC 8-16 ug/ml) one AMP-resistant? strain MIC >128 ug/ml, P. aeruginosa 10 strains (MIC 16-32 ug/ml), A. baumannii 9 strains (MIC 16-32 ug/ml) one AMP-resistant? strain MIC >128 ug/ml, and K. pneumoniae 7 isolates (MIC 16 ug/ml) one AMP-resistant? strain MIC >128 ug/ml.MOA:bacteria:E. coli:  act on membranes: charge neutralization and membrane permeation (PI) and depolarization.Structure:  random coil in water and helical in 25 mM SDS.In vitro toxicity: sheep RBC, less than 20% hemolysis at 512 ug/ml: poor hemo.lytic.Animal model:mouse: wound infected with P. aeruginosa, treated with TS-CATH hydrogels (10 mg/kg), dose-dependent reduced bacterial burden on day 7 and promoted wound healing on day 13.  Systemic bacteremia: IP infected with ceftazidime-resistant E. coli, IP treated with 10 mg/kg protected 85.7% mice from death. At 8 h post treatment, the peptide suppressed the levels of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6.",
