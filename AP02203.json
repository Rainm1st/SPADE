  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Drug/AMPs in use: Daptomycin was approved by FDA in 2003 to treat soft-tissue infections, and in 2006 to treat S. aureus bacteremia and right-sided endocarditis.Warning: the sequence is a close mimic of the natural counterpart.Chemical modification: The natural form is cyclic due to the ester bond between the hydroxyl of T4 and the carboxyl of kynurenine-13 (represented by Y here). In daptomycin, the N-terminus is lipidated with n-decanoyl fatty acid chain to replace the C11 branched fatty acid in the natural form of A21978C1 (Eliopoulos GM et al., 1985). Other nonstandard amino acids include ornithine-6 (represented with K), (2S,3R)-3-methyl-glutamic acid-12 (represented with E), and three D-amino acids at positions N2, A8, and S11.Activity:  Natural form is active against various Gram-positive bacteria S. aureus, S. faecalis, S. epidermidis (MIC 0.125-0.5 ug/ml), L. monocytogenes (MIC 4-16 ug/ml), S. pyogenes (MIC <0.06 ug/ml), S. agalactiae (MIC 0.25-0.5 ug/ml), group G. streptococci (MIC <0.06 ug/ml), V. streptococci (MIC <0.06-4 ug/ml), S. pneumoniae (MIC <0.06-0.125 ug/ml). This is another anionic peptide that is distinct from many of the cationic AMPs. Its activity requires the presence of Ca2+ (calcium) that causes the aggregation of the peptide.
