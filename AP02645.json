    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide most resembles (44.4% similarity)fish NRC-19. It inhibits the spore germination of the shrimp pathogen F. oxysporum.  Activity is salt-insensitive. In complex with DPC (1:100, P/L ratio, pH 3.5), it is helical from residues 6-18 determined by solution NMR.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. Three phenylalanines are aligned on the hydrophobic surface and can play an important role in membrane targeting as previously demonstrated forhuman LL-37. Since it corresponds to the C-terminal fragment of hemocyanin, it can be obtained in large quantities by proteolytic cleavage of the protein.",
