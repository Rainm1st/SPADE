  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Peptide engineering: RC-101 is obtained by changing R9 to K9 to facilitate chrorophore-labeling. Despite one amino acid change, RC-101 was significantly more potent than retrocyclin-1 across the panel of primary isolates.  94.44% similar to Retrocyclin-1 (which protects human peripheral blood lymphocytes from infection by R5 and X4 strains of HIV-1).Activity: inhibit S. aureus USA300 (Lamers et al., 2011), viruses HIV-1, SARS-Cov-2, influenza.Toxicity:  RC-101 was well tolerated by host tissues, and also by commensal vaginal bacteria.  Not toxic to human nasal epithelia up to 200 uM, nor did it induce a proinflammatory response in these cells (PMID 21825301). (Eade et al., 2013).MOA: Binds to HIV-1 gp120. It is a potential lead as a microbicide.The original entry share the same sequence with AP804, thereby merged. 2/2023.",
