    "Literature": "The source organism is used to produce penicillin industrially.Activity: inhibited the growth of  filamentous fungi: A. flavus (sensitivity +), A. fumigatus (+++), A. giganteus (++), A. nidulans (+++), A. niger (+++), A.terreus (-), B. cinerea (+++), C. carbonum (++), F. oxysporum (+), F.sambucinum (-), G. roseum (+), M.circinelloides (-), M.genevensis (-), N. crassa (++), P.chrysogenum Q176 (-), P. chrysogenum (wild-type) (+), and T. koningii (+++). Treated with 50 ug PAF/ml: + indicates 31.2-54.9% growth, ++ indicates 10.5-12.9% growth; and +++ indicates less than 10% growth 0.5-8.7%.  PAF inhibited the growth of a variety of filamentous fungi, including opportunistic human pathogenic and phytopathogenic fungi, whereas bacterial and yeast cells were unaffected.Antifungal robustness: 20-40 mM MgCl2 reduced peptide activity, 60-100 mM MgCl2 and Na2SO2 both had a large impact on peptide activity, while the effects of KCl and NaCl are relatively small.Structure: Solution structure of PAF was determined by NMR (Batta G et al. 2009 FEBS J 276: 2875-2890).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.
