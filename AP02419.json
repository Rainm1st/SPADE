    "Literature": "Chemical modification: C-terminal amidation.Activity: Active against S. aureus (MIC 34 uM), but not Gram-negative bacteria or yeast.SAR: Changes of residues G3, G6, and S7 to K increased peptide activity as well as activity spectrum. By changing G3, G6, and S7 to lysines (i.e. feleucin-K3), the antibacterial activity of the peptide was enhanced (MIC 7-14 uM). Reg. 8/6/2014; 5/2020 GW.",
