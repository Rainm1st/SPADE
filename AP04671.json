    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (96.15%) toL-PK: 23%, A=S: 15%, T=L: 12%.Chemical modification:  N-terminal acetylation (XXE) and C-terminal amidation (XXA).Activity: active against Gram- E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 2 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 8 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 (MIC 4 uM), Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC 4 uM), S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC 4 uM), S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 (MIC 2 uM).SAR: PL-31 (K22 is a D-amino acids): activity against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. epidermidis increased; PL-32 (L12 and L20 are D-aa): activity against E. coli and K, pneumoniae reduced by 2 fold and activity against S. pneumoniae increased by 4-fold.Synergy:antibiotics:  PL-5 displayed excellent synergy with levofloxacin hydrochloride (FICI 0.078).Animal model:mouse: wound healing, substantially reduced S. aureus burden at high or low doses (ref).Clinical trials: in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, PL-5 showed better efficacy than placebo, indicating its potential application in treating the diabetic foot wounds (Diabetes2024).",
