    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: TP4 was related to O. niloticus moronecidin-like peptide (98% identity). It has a Arg-rich tail.Activity:  Active against Gram-negative V. vulnificus 204 (MIC 0.03 ug/ml), A. hydrophila BCRC 13018 (MIC 1.05 ug/ml), V. alginolyticus (MIC 0.03 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa ATCC 19660 (MIC 0.52 ug/ml), Gram-positive bacteria S. agalactiae 819 (MIC 2.1 ug/ml), E. faecalis BCRC 10066 (MIC 8.39 ug/ml), and S. agalactiae BCRC 10787 (MIC: 0.13 ug/ml). It also inhibited the growth of multidrug resistant gastric pathogen H. pylori, based on its in vitro and in vivo efficacy (animal model:mouse and animal model:rabbit) (). This peptide was also reported byAcosta et al., 2013and named Oreoch-2, which is active against S. aureus (MIC 5 uM), B. subtilis (MIC 1.7 uM), P. aeruginosa (6.7 uM), E. coli (5 uM), E. tarda (MIC 20 uM), C. albicans (26.7 uM). TP4 is also called MSP-4 (Kuo et al., 2018).  This peptide may also be used to treat triple-negative breast cancer by binding to mitochondria where it disrupts Ca2+ homeostasis and induces an AP-1 protein called FOSB similar to anthracyclines (Ting CH et al., 2016).Toxicity:  fish erythrocytes, HC50 50 ug/ml, moderate hemolytic.Structure:You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Peptide engineering: dual stapled peptides (TP4-3) have been made based on TP4 to increase peptide stability (in 50% human serum) and in vivo efficacy (Yeh et al., 2023).Animal model:mouse: the stapled peptide increased animal survival to 87.5% on day 7.Updated 5/2015; 6/2016; Jan2018; 7/2021; 11/2023; 5/2024",
