  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Mol. Wt: 1339.7. Active against S. aureus USA300 (MIC 3.1 uM, see ref), E. faecium ATCC51559 (MIC 12.5 uM), and S. epidermidis 1457 (MIC 3.1 uM) (Wang et al., 2018).  Structural determination of DFTamP1 by NMR spectroscopy revealed a broad hydrophobic surface bound to membrane-mimic SDS micelles, providing a basis for its potency against MRSA known to deploy positively charged moieties on the surface as a mechanism for resistance. The original Oreoch-2, being identical to TP-4 (AP2135), was replaced Jan2018; updated 9/2018.",
