    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (83.33%) toCm-p1Mol formula: C66H109N21O18; Mol Wt: 1484.725; Mol Ex Coeff:  0; GRAVY: -0.14.Activity: Active against C. albicans 01U or 38 U (MIC 10 ug/ml), C. parapsilosis (MIC 32 ug/ml), C. neoformans L26 (MIC 64 ug/ml), C. neoformans L30 (MIC 64 ug/ml), T.mentagrophytes (MIC 128 ug/ml), and T. rubrum (MIC 10 ug/ml).In vitro toxicity: MTT assay: mouse macrophage line RAW 264.7, Cm-p5 showed no toxicity at 400 ug/ml; hRBC: not hemo.lytic at 400 ug/ml.Structure: the peptide is helical based on both CD and NMR.You can rotate, zoom, and view the crystal structure 2BZZherein the PDB.MOA: biophysical studies using liposomes suggest a membrane surface covering without memrbane permeation (Gonzalez-Garcia et al., 2024).SAR: Compared to the WT, Cm-p5 (Cm-p1 appended with LF at the C-terminus) has increased antifungal actvity but low toxicity to mammalian cells. Cm-p3 (appended with RC at the C-terminus) and Cm-p4 (appended with MK at the C-terminus) are more or less similar to Cm-P1 with moderate or weak antifungal activity. These results suggest the need of a hydrophobic pair for improved activity.Animal model:mouse failed: In a systemic candidiasis model in mice, intraperitoneal administration of Cm-p5 at 5 or 25 mg/kg was unable to control the fungal kidney burden. In contrast, amphotericin B was able to.The original entry VCP-VT1 (insect peptide) shares the seqquence with Temporin-1CSb (frog peptide) and therefore it has been merged with AP595. 2/2023; 11/2024.",
