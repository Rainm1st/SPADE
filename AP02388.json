  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Originally found as an enzyme inhibitor in the 1930s. Cys residues exist at conserved positions 5, 14, 30, 38, 51 and 55.  High stability of BPTI towards temperature, acids, bases, organic 55 solvents and proteolytic degradation has been reported (Fritz et al., 1983). It served as a model small protein for NMR studies in many aspects. There are over NMR+X-ray 100 structures for WT, mutants, and complexed forms of BPTI in the PDB.You can rotate, zoom, and view the crystal structure of BPTI in complex with trypsinherein the PDB.  In 2014, it was established as an antifungal AMP with a novel mechanism of action (MOA) by inhibiting Mg2+ uptake. Consistent with this 152 notion, overexpression of ALR1 rescued the BPTI-dependent growth inhibition. Active against C. albicans (IC50 10 uM) and S. cerevisiae (IC50 4.5 uM).",
