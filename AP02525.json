  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "The core sequence prior to modification is 47.8% similar toAP01002 Mutacin III.Chemical modification:  This peptide contains a special amino acid labionin at positions 1, 4, 8, 10, 13, and 17 (represented with S before modification). Labs 1,4 and labs 10, 13 are connected via a carbon-carbon bond, while labs 4, 8 and labs 13, 17 form normal thioether bonds. In addition, a disulfide bond occurs between C9 and C18.  Note that Labionin is a triamino acid with a 2S,4S,8R configuration, and consists of a central quarternary carbon atom with a lanthionine motif and an unusual methylene bridge, which establishes a covalent link to a further amino acid moiety.Activity: Bioactivity assays revealed that labyrinthopeptin A2 has an excellent efficacy against neuropathic pain in an in vivo mouse model (ED50 = 50 mg/kg).  labyrinthopeptins A2, the prototype congeners of carbacyclic lanthipeptides, inhibits the proliferation of diverse enveloped viruses, including dengue virus, Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), chikungunya virus, Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus, in the low micromolar to nanomolar range (Hans Prochnow et al., 2020).Structure:  structure by X-ray?
