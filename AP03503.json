    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (97.83%) toplant Ec-AMP-D1It differs from Ec-AMP-D1 only at one amino acid at position 45: H here and A in Ec-AMP-D1. (typed) GRAVY: -0.496; M Wt: 5050.767; Mol formula: C205H324N68O65S8; Mol ex coeff: 1990 (paired Cys).Activity: Due to a less amount isolated, its antifungal activity was tested only against F. oxysporum (IC50 102 ug/ml) and P. infestans (IC50 102 ug/ml), weaker than Ec-AMP-D1. However, the activity of Ec-AMP-D2 against the oomycete P. infestans was lower than that of Ec-AMP-D1. The IC50 for inhibition of hyphal development was 50 ug/ml.",
