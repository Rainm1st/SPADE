  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: IDR-1010 is active against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa (MIC 2.3 and 9 ug/ml). It also demonstrated a potent ability to suppress endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells  (PBMCs) by 94%.Animal model:mouse:  It also completely protected mice against an invasive S. aureus infection when given I.P. to mice at 8 mg/kg 4 h prior to initiation of the infection.Surface immobilized peptide: Surface immobilization led to enhanced antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa.  The quartz-coated peptide adopted helical conformation in the presence of DPC or DMPC:DMPG SUVs. The original has been merged with AP1640 due to identical sequence 5/2017. GW",
