    "Literature": "Three S-S bonds: 3-34, 20-39, and 24-41.Activity: Active against multiple fungi with MIC 5-20 uM. CopN1, with 43 residues, is active against E. coli and S. aureus.MOA: it induces apoptosis-like death in E. coli (Choi et al., 2016.Anti-inflammatory:  immune modulatory action of coprisin is initiated by suppressing the binding of LPS to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and subsequently inhibiting the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear translocation of NF-kB (see the ref in the PDB link).Animal model:rat:  Wound healing effect: Coprisin accelerated wound closure (infected with S. aureus) both grossly and microscopically compared with the untreated group (Lee et al., 2013).Structure:You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.
