    "Literature": "Activity: Strongly active against S. aureus ATCC12600 (MIC 6 uM) and E. coli ATCC11775 (MIC 3 uM).Toxicity: not hemo.lytic: hRBC: HC50 >300 uM. Additional peptides have been identified in the same species. Found in multiple species (FIMS). See also Shang et al. (2009) Zoo Sci 26, 220-226.Immune modulation: Chensinin-1 binds LPS with a possible use as an anti-endotoxin molecule (Dong W et al. 2015). Derivatives of this peptide reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha (Dong et al., 2017). Updated 12/2015; 9/2020",
