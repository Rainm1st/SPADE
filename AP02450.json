    "Literature": "BLIS: bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances. An acyl chain (C15 to C17 carbons) is attached to E1, residue 2 is an ornithine (represented as K), and the carboxylic group of C-terminal I10  forms an ester bond with the side chain of Y3.Activity: Active against Gram-positive bacteria (B. subtilis, L. acidophilus ATCC 4356, B. linens, C. Wmi NCTC 7547,  L. monocytogenes, L. innocua, B. cereus, L. innocua ATCC 33090,  L. innocua 1572, L. ivanovii 5 NCTC 11007, L. seeligeri AC 82/4, L. welshimeri AC 73/2, (Motta et al., 2007b), and Gram-negative bacteria (S. Gallinarum, E. carotovora 413, A. hydrophila, P. haemolytica, P. haemolytica, clinical isolate). Also inhibited the replication of viruses such as equine arteritis virus (EAV) and feline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1) by over 94%. Updated 9/2017.",
