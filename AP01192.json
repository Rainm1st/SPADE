  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "It is the first microhalocin to be described. Possible two S-S bonds. Active against Hbt. salinarum NRC817, Hbt. sp. GRB and Hfx. gibbonsi. Most active at the transition to the stationary phase.  Halocin S8 is quite robust, as it can be desalted, boiled, subjected to organic solvents, and stored at 4 degrees C for extended periods without losing activity. Unlike the peptide bacteriocins and the eucaryocins, microhalocins possess a large number of neutral residues and are not cationic, leaving their mechanism(s) of action mostly a mystery. The exact length of the peptide may be longer. Updated 6/2015.",
