  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (95%) toPlectasinC: 15%, G: 20%, K: 13%.Activity: active against S. aureus ATCC 43300 or ATCC 25923 (MIC 1-4 ug/ml) and S. hyicus ACCC 61734 or NCTC 10350 (MIC 1-4 ug/ml), slightly stronger than NZ2114.Structure: CD indicates the peptide is structured in water.Recombinant production:yeast:Pichia pastoris: expressed (secreted proteins 1505 mg/L after 120 h) and purified in a 5-L fermentor.Stability: the peptide was ok 20-80oC but lost activity at 100oC; easily digested by proteases in all body fluids, but stable to pepsin and trypsin.Antimicrobial robustness: pH-insensitive (pH 2-10).Toxicity:  murine RBC: 1.11% hemolysis at 256 ug/ml: not hemo.lytic.Animal model:mouse: peritonitis  infected with S. hyicus NCTC 10350: 5 mg/kg increased survival rate to 50% (cfs: NZ2114: 33%) but the same survival rate at 10 mg/kg (83.3%).",
