    "Literature": "Hedyotide B1 is active against E. coli and S. salivarius. However, hedyotide B2 was found to be inactive against the bacteria tested under the conditions. Its exact functional roles remain to be elucidated. The authors suggested the name \"uncyclotides\" in this article for uncyclized cyclotides.",
