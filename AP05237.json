    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (97.5%) toNZL (NZ2114 variant 6)G: 20%; C: 15%.  Four K residues were replaced with four R.Activity:  Active against S. aureus ATCC43300 MRSA or TCC25923 (MIC 0.46-0.91 uM) and S. hyicus NCTC10350 or 437â€“2 (MIC 0.91 uM).Peptide stability:  not heat stable at 100oC after 1 h incubation (ok till 80oC). pepsin-resistant but trypsin-sensitive.Antimicrobial robustness: activity is pH-insensitive (pH 2-10).In vitro toxicity: mouse RBC: 1.9% hemolysis at 128 ug/ml (poor hemo.lytic). No cytotoxicity to HaCaT cell (92.7% survival at 128 ug/ml).Animal model:mouse: peritonitis model, female ICR mice infected with S. hyicus NCTC10350, i.p./i.p., mice survived 67% and 100% treated twice at 5 and 10 mg/kg, respectively.In vivo PK:mice:IV: t1/2 0.32-0.45 h Cmax 2.85-20.55 ug/ml (Zheng et al., 2022).Recombinant production:yeast:Pichia pastoris X33: expressed and ion exchange purified, yield: 965 mg/L; purity: 92.6% based on 5 L fermenetor.",
