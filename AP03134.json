    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (82.2%) toS100A7. 11% K; GRAVY: -0.57; mol Wt: 11304.902; mol formula: C497H784N130O153S7;Expression:  S100A15 is expressed in low levels in healthy skin and at increased levels in psoriasis (Wolf et al., 2003). Also, S100A15 is constitutively expressed in cultured human epidermal keratinocytes and is inducible by E. coli, proinflammatory cytokines and interleukin 1beta via TLR4.Activity:  Active against E. coli.Structure:  Its 3D structure bound to Zinc and calcium has been determined as a globular structure with multiple helices.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. edited 7/2021",
