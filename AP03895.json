  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is poorly similar (87.5%) toparent TetraF2W. W: 50%.Chemical modification:  C-terminal amidation.Activity: Active against E. coli K12 (MIC 25 uM), S. epidermidis 1457 (MIC 6.2-12.5 uM), B. subtilis 168 (MIC 3.1-6.2 uM), and S. aureus USA300 (MIC 1.6-3.1 uM; MBC 3.1 uM). Can disrupt preformed MRSA biofilms. Also active against C. albicans (MIC 25 uM), C-glabrata (MIC >25 uM), and C. tropicalis (MIC 3.1 uM).Antimicrobial robustness: pH-insensitive (6.8-8); NaCl-insensitive:S. aureus (150 mM), serum-sensitive (5%).Toxicity:  human RBC HC50 20 uM.MOA:bacteria: Compared to KR, RK, and KK variants in the series, RR is most effective in MRSA killing and membrane permeabiliation.Surface immobilization: the peptide has been covantly coupled to the PET surface and demonstrated antibacterial and antibiofilm activity.",
