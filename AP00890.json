  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Initially reported as a separate peptide called pilosulin 2 (see the ref). In 2017, a new form was reported (Dekan et al., 2017). This chain (AP890)  can form a heterodimer with pilosulin 3 (AP891). Because of this reason, AP891 is kept in the database as well. AP890 and AP891 forms an antiparallel dimer connected by two disulfide bonds: C16 of AP890 with C17 of AP891; C23 of AP890 and C10 of AP891. NMR determination revealed two helical peptides connected by two intermolecular S-S bonds. Active against E. coli ATCC 25922, K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, K. pneumoniae ATCC BAA-2146, A. baumannii ATCC 19606 (MIC 0.025 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, P. aeruginosa FADDI-PA70, S. aureus ATCC 43300, S. aureus NRS 1, S. aureus NRS 17, S. aureus NARSA-VRS1 (MIC 3.2-6.4), S. aureus NARSA-VRS10, and S. pneumoniae ATCC 700677(MIC mostly  0.1-0.8 uM).Toxicity: Also toxic to human kidney cells (LC50=0.57 uM) and highly hemolytic ability (HC50=2.2 uM). So, this is a true poison-type AMP. Peptide connection mode was corrected and updated 5/2017",
