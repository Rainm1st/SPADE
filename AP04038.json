    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (55%) toMB-21K: 28%; L=A: 22%.Activity: active against C. gattii AFLP4 (MIC 5 uM), C. guilliermondii ATCC 6260 (MIC 2.5 uM), C. tropicalis ATCC 750 (MIC 5 uM), C. utilis ATCC 9950 (MIC 5 uM), (MIC 2.5 uM), C. parapsilosis ATCC 2209 (MIC 10 uM), C. albicans MYA 2876 (MIC 2.5 uM), C. krusei ATCC 6258 (MIC 30 uM), and C-glabrata ATCC 1707 or ATCC 90030 (MIC>40 uM). Fungicidal concentrations are similar. Can rapidly kill C. tropicalis at 10 uM.Also inhibited C. tropicalis biofilms:fungi formation. Disrupted preformed biofilms (61.9% at MIC and 73.4% at 10xMIC.Toxicity: murine RAW 264.7 (IC50 69.2 uM).Synergy:antibiotic: killed C. tropicalis ATCC 750 (FICI 0.123) and C. gattii AFLP4 (FICI 0.069) strains synergistically with commercial antibiotic amphotericin B.MOA:fungi: damage membranes via permeabilization. Activity is retained in the presence of RPMI-1640, D-Sorbitol (cell wall), but reduced by Ergosterol (memrbane).Animal model:wax moth: the peptide treated up to 100 uM showed protective effect on Galleria mellonella.
