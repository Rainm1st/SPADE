    "Literature": "Constitutively expressed in multiple tisssues and can be induced in the gill after infection. APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide most resembles (74.1% similarity)AP2631.  Mol. Wt: 2350.7; GRAVY=0.517.  It appears to be the same piscidin in a different sequence. While the previous one contains additional four residues QNVE at the C-terminus,  the current form has additional three residues GEG at the N-terminus. Whether both are native AMPs remain to be established.Activity: This form is active against S. iniae FP5228 (MIC < 0.9 uM), V. harveyi ATCC14126 (MIC < 0.9 uM), V. ordalii KCCM41669 (MIC < 0.9 uM),  E. coli JM109 (MIC 1.9-3.9 uM), V. alginolyticus KCCM2928 (MIC 0.9-1.9 uM), V. campbellii KCCM40684 (MIC 1.9 uM), and V. vulnificus KCTC2982 (MIC 3.9-7.8 uM). Inactive:  E.tarda (MIC 250-500 uM).Toxicity: low Hemo.lytic (HC50 > 100 uM; 13% at 125 uM, 28.9% at 250 uM, and 70% at 500 uM).  The previous form AP2631 was found to be less active than this sequence, likely due to the use of partial sequence of the peptide in the experiments. Updated 7/2021",
