    "Literature": "Discovery: a fragment of of Litopeidin correspoinding to residues 28-51 (predicted by machine learning from the full length).Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar to (41.67%) todesigned CGS13R: 33%, S: 13%.Activity: active against Gram- A. baumannii CGMCC 1.6769 (MIC 6-12 uM), E. coli CGMCC 1.2389 (MIC 3-6 uM), V. alginolyticus CGMCC 1.1833 (MIC 6-12 uM), V. harveyi CGMCC 1.1593 (MIC 6-12 uM),  V. fluvialis CGMCC 1.1609 (MIC 6-12 uM), V. parahaemolyticus CGMCC 1.1615 (MIC 6-12 uM), Gram+ S. aureus CGMCC 1.2465 (MIC 6-12 uM), and fungi C. neoformans CGMCC 2.1563 (MIC 6-12 uM), F. oxysporum CGMCC 3.6785 (MIC 6-12 uM), F. solani CGMCC 3.584 (MIC 6-12 uM), F. graminearum CGMCC 3.4521 (MIC 12-24 uM), and A. niger CGMCC 3.316 (MIC 12-24 uM). Also inhibited White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) replication in Hpt cells at 10 uM. Pretreated virus lost infectivity.Structure: predicted to be helical.In vitro toxicity: not toxic to Hpt cells at 15 um (MTT).MOA:virus: significantly down-regulated the transcription levels of IE1 and VP28 genes, as well as the viral DNA accumulation. Also regulated immune-related genes Relish, ALF, Crustin, and lysozyme 1.Animal model:shrimp: survival: protected animals from viral infection.",
