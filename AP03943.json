    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (42.11%) toinsect Lasioglossin LL-III: 29%; K: 18%. GRAVY: 0.3; M Wt: 1868.244; M formula: C86H148N22O22; mol ex coeff: 0. Two residues were changed.Activity: inhibited  M. tuberculosis 78% at 100 uM (anti-TB). It displayed dose-dependent inhibitory activity against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa (inhibition zone).Half-life in vitro:serum:human: half life is 3.058 min.In vitro toxicity: not toxic to human macrophages at 108 uM. Uptake of Angie1 by macrophages was equally efficient when delivered alone or incorporated into liposomes. Showed no toxicity at 100 uM zebrafish embryos in vitro.",
