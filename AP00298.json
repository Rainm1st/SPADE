    "Literature": "Activity: Active against E. coli ML-35, L. monocytogenes strain EGD but not C.albicans till 400 ug/ml.Structure: It contains three disulfide bonds (C3-C29, C8-C23, and C13-C30). The seq has been verified by experiments (Derache et al 2009 Antimicrob Agents Chemother 55:4647-55). The 3D structure is determined by NMR and revealed no clear amphipathicity (see the PDB link below).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.MOA:bacteria: the peptide appears to target membranes as the D and L forms (D=L) showed similar activity against Gram- E. coli, S. enteritidis, and G+ bacteria B. cereus, and L. monocytogenes (Derache C et al. 2011 JBC).SAR: The structure of the K31A mutant has also been solved (View the mutant structure PDB 2LG6).
