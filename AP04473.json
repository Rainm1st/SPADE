    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (80%) toM4R: 25%, others 13%.Peptide engineering:  the peptide is a branched form constructed on the platform of lysine to increase in vivo life time.  Warning: This dendrimer contains 4 chains of the same sequence shown.Activity: active against E. coli (MIC 16-128 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 or 885149 or 891 (MIC 16-32 ug/ml),  K.pneumoniae W99FI0057 (MIC >128 ug/ml), S.aureus ATCC 25923 or MIU-68A (MIC 128 ug/ml). mainly acttive against Gram- bacteria.MOA:bacteria:E. coli: It permeabilized inner membrane of E. coli ML-35.Peptide stability in serum: peptide was detected after 24 h in human serum/plasma.",
