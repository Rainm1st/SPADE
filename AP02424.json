    "Literature": "Sequence analysis:  85.29% similar toAP896 BF-CATH.Activity:  active against Gram+ E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and a clinical isolate (MIC 7.7-31 uM), S. aureus ATCC 29213 and a clinical isolate (MIC 7.7 uM), S. pyogenes clinical isolate (MIC 3.8 uM), Gram- P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and a clinical isolate (MIC 0.24-3.8 uM), K. pneumoniae clinical isolate (MIC 1.9 uM), E. coli ATCC 25922 and a clinical isolate (MIC 0.06-3.8 uM), and A. baumannii clinical isolate (MIC 3.8 uM).Fungi: active against yeasts C-parapsilosis ATCC 22019 (MIC>40 uM), C. krusei ATCC 6258 (MIC 40 uM),  C. tropicalis LABMIC 0109 (MIC 10-40 uM), C. albicans LABMIC 0107 or 0108 (MIC 20-40 uM), C. parapsilosis LABMIC 0113 (MIC 2.5 uM), C. laurentii LABMIC 0404 (MIC 20 uM), Dermatophythes M. canis LABMIC 0401 (MIC 1.25 uM), T. rubrum LABMIC 0203 or 0204 (MIC 5 uM) (Cavalcante et al., 2017).Appeared to have proinflammatory effect on immune cells such as Raw 264.7 cells (Oliveira-Júnior et al., 2018).Half-life in vitro:serum:human: half-life 71 min (50% serum).Structure: residues 3-21 are helical when bound to DPC micelles.You can rotate, zoom, and view the crystal structure of BPTI in complex with trypsinherein the PDB. Ctn is toxic to cancer cells HeLa S3 and U937, in the low uM range for THP-1 (IC50 ~1.56 uM) and MM6 (IC50 3.12 uM), and above 12.5 uM for HL-60 and Jurkat E6.1.SAR: Like LL-37, the N-terminal fragment Ctn[1-14] has weak activity, while the c-terminal fragment Ctn[15-34] is antibacterial and antitumor with increased cell selectivity (Falcao CB et al., 2015).Toxicity: Ctn was the most active peptide against dermatophytes. Toxic to human fibroblasts (IC50 6.25 uM) and also the most toxic to healthy eukaryotic cells. Human RBC: HC50 < 100 uM. Fragments Ctn[1–14] and Ctn[15–35] lost activity against dermatophytes, but became more active against pathogenic yeasts, including several Candida species, both clinical isolates and standard strains, with MICs as low as 5 uM (Cavalcante CS et al., 2016).Synergy:drug:  it showed synergistic antifungal activity with amphotericin B (FICI 0.26) (Cavalcante et al., 2017).Reg. 8/2014; Update 4/2016; 11/2016; 7/2021; 12/2024 GW.",
