At 30 ug/ml inactive against C-graminicola, B-cinerea, and H-sativum (MIC> 30 ug/ml). The IC50 for inhibition of F. graminearum spore germination (IC50 15 ug/ml), for F. verticillioides (IC50 ~ 8.5 ug/ml), and for D. maydis (IC50 about 12.5 ug/ml). The Ec-AMP-D1 was only weakly active against F. oxysporum (IC50 102 ug/ml). The Ec-AMP-D1 peptide inhibited hyphal development at IC50 of 25.5 ug/ml.",
