  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (39.39%) toRetro-FK-13Activity: active against E. coli (MIC 15-20 ug/ml), S. aureus (MIC 15 ug/ml), and L. casei (MIC 20 ug/ml) (Gasanov et al., 2024). Also: C.albicans 927 (MIC 1024 ug/ml), C. neoformans 3465 (MIC 62.5 ug/ml),  R. mucilaginosa 132 (MIC 62.5 ug/ml), T. cutaneum no. 18 (MIC 31.2 ug/ml), Geotrichum sp. 1206 (MIC 31.2 ug/ml).Structure:  it is more helical in 50% TFE.Animal model:mouse: MRSA infected animals treated with Wharton's Jelly-Derived MSCs (WJ-MSCs) engineered to express the antimicrobial peptide SE-33 showed safety and efficacy in reducing bacterial load, inflammation, and mortality in an S. aureus pneumonia model.Recombinant production:stem cells: SE-33 expressing cells are used for treatment (Gasanov et al. 2025).Updated 3/2025",
