    "Literature": "Activity: Active against Gram- E. coli ATCC 25922 or O157:H7 or PCN033 or RS218 (MIC 0.66-10 uM), S. typhimurium ATCC 14028 or 700408 (MIC 0.66-1.33 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883 (MIC 0.66 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 5.32 uM), Gram+ L. monocytogenes ATCC 19115 (MIC 1.33 uM), S. aureus ATCC 25923 or BAA-39 or 43300 MRSA (MIC 0.33-0.66 uM). Also active against Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 29213 (MIC 10 uM), MRSA WKZ-2 (MIC 5 uM), B. globigii TNO BMO13 (MIC 20 uM), Gram- E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 10 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 10 uM); P. aeruginosa PAO1 (MIC 20 uM), and S. enteriditis 706 RIVM (MIC 10 uM) (Bosso et al., 2017).Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-insensitive:E. coli (100 mM); NaCl-insensitive:P. aeruginosa (100 mM); NaCl-insensitive:S. typhimurium (100 mM);NaCl-insensitive:K. pneumoniae (100 mM); NaCl-insensitive:S. aureus (100 mM) but 43300 is sensitive; NaCl-insensitive:L. monocytogenes (100 mM);Variant?: In a subsequent work, Xiao Y et al 2006 J Biol Chem 281: 2858-67) cloned a 32-residue peptide, which contains additional LVQRG at the N-terminus compared to CMAP27. Which one corresponds to the native CATH-2 is not yet clear. The additional five residues appeared not to have a significant effect on antimicrobial activity (Dijk A et al 2009 Mol Immun. 46: 2465-2473).SAR: For CAMP-27, a change of the last Gly to NH2 (amidation) greatly augmented antibacterial activity against E. coli, to a lesser degree against S. aureus, but not against B. globigii (van Dijk et al 2009 Mol Immunol 46: 2465-73).  Antibacterial activities of other synthetic peptides: the N-terminal 15 residues are most potent, peptide residues 1-21 and peptide residues 12-26 are weakest; substitution of P by G only reduced activity slightly, but a change of Pro by Leu greatly reduced antibacterial activity. The potent peptides can kill bacteria rapidly in 5-10 minutes. Of interest, peptides corresponding to residues 1-15 or residues 12-26 showed poor hemolytic activity. Xiao et al (2008 J Innate Immu 1:268) also showed that the Pro residue is important for both antimicrobial activity and LPS neutralization.  Substitution of the three F2, F5, and F12 residues with W (peptide RWGRWLRKIRRWRPK) further improved antimicriobial and LPS-neutrolizing activities. This peptide derivative inhibits S. epidermidis biofilm formation at 2.5 uM (four times below MIC) based on CV staining. It impairs existing biofilms.Structure:You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.  Updated 2/2014; 6/2018; 7/2021; 8/2022; 4/2024.",
