    "Literature": "Discovery: The peptide was found via peptide screening.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 36.4% similarity toinsect Ponericin-Q42. GRAVY: -1.65; Mol. Wt: 3358.828; Mol Formula: C151H230N55O34; Mol Ex. Coeff.: 8530.Activity: Active against E. coli (MIC 2 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 4 uM); S. enterica (MIC 4 uM);  K. pneumoniae (MIC 2 uM);  S. aureus (MIC 4 uM);  B. subtilis (MIC 2 uM); S. pyogenes (MIC 4 uM); and E. faecalis (MIC 4 uM).SAR: The peptide became less active and finally lost activitiy with the sequence deletion (YR23, MIC 2-4 uM; YR20, MIC 6-15 uM; YH17 active only against E. coli).Structure: The structure of YR26 was determined in SDS micelles using isotope-labeled peptides. A novel helix-turn-helix structure is found.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.  It also binds LPS (anti-sepsis) and supresses TNFalpha (anti-inflammatory).Puzzle: Whether this peptide is generated in vivo remains to be determined. UPdated 7/2021; source 10/2023",
