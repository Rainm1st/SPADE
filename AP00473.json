    "Literature": "Discovery: First AMP isolated from mast cells.Activity: Active against E. coli (MIC 12.5 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 50 uM), S. typhimurium, B. subtilis (MIC 12.5 uM), and S. aureus USA300 or MRSA (MIC 1-4 uM) (Kim JP et al 2010) (Menousek J et al 2012).fungi: C.albicans (MIC > 125 ug/ml).Virus: It is also active against channel catfish virus (CCV), frog virus 3 (FV3) (Chinchar VG et al. 2004). inhibited Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 HIV-1 (EC50 2.1 uM). It also inhibited SARS-CoV-2 (Bepler et al., 2024). The activity reported by Chinchar et al. did not depend on peptide C-terminal amidation (piscidin-1N: c-terminal amidation; piscidin-1H, no amidation. Note that both forms can occur in nature).Antimicrobial robustness: Activity is salt-insensitive: NaCl-insensitive:E. coli (up to 256 mM); NaCl-sensitive:B. subtilis (256 mM).  For ref, see AP02680.Toxicity: TC50 6.9 uM in CEM-SS cells  (Wang, G et al., 2010). highly hemolytic HC50 at 25 ug/ml (20 uMMenousek et al., 2012).Structure: For structure in SDS micelles, refer to Lee SA et al. 2007 Biochemistry 46: 3653-63. For structure in DPC, see Campagna S et al. 2007 Biochemistry 46, 1771-8.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Structure in lipid bilayer by solid-state NMR is here.Substitution of Gly8 with Pro8 or a Lys peptoid residue improved peptide selectivity. It was proposed that conformational flexibility and positive charge are important for membrane penetration (Kim JP et al 2010). This peptide also binds to metal Cu2+ (Rai et al., 2018).Updated 11/2012; 2/2014; 9/2014; Jan2019; 7/2024 GW.",
