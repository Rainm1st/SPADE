  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Active against Gram+ L. lactis subsp. lactis (Minimal effective concentration, MEC, 0.7 uM), S. aureus (MEC 0.6 uM), Gram- E. coli D31 (MEC 1.8 uM), and V. parahemolyticus (MEC 3.5 uM).  Also active against S. aureus ATCC 43300 or ATCC 25923 or E48 (MIC 8-16 ug/ml), S. pseudintermedius A2101 (MIC 8 ug/ml), S. agalactiae ATCC 13813 (MIC 4 ug/ml), S. hyicus NCTC 10350 (MIC 16 ug/ml), S. epidermidis ATCC 35984 or ATCC 12228 or G-81 (MIC 4 ug/ml), E-coli ATCC 25922 (MIC >64 ug/ml), S-typhimurium CVCC 14028 (MIC >64 ug/ml), and  S-flexneri CMCC 51571 (MIC > 64 ug/ml).Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: 6His-tag expressed by fusing with a acidic flag sequence DYKDDDDK, affinity purification, and released by cleaving with  enterokinase: 5 L fermentor:  expression level in supernatant: 587 mg/L; yield: 216 mg/L (93% pure).Toxicity: Murine RBC 1.29% hemolysis at 256 ug/ml (poor hemo.lytic).peptide stability: MIC retained after 4 h treatment with proteases  pepsin and trypsin; tolerate temperature till 80oC;Antimicrobial robustness: pH-insensitive (pH 2-10); NaCl-insensitive:S. epidermidis (150 mM); KCl-insensitive:S. epidermidis (4.5 mM), MgCl2-insensitive:S. epidermidis (1 mM), FeCl3-insensitive:S. epidermidis (4 uM).In vivo toxicity:mice: IP injection of AOD to mice daily at 10 mg/kg for 7 days showed no sign of toxicity: no weight loss nor histological abnormality (see 2024 ref for SAR).Animal model:mouse: skin infection and treatment led to observable CFU decrease after 1 week (Zhao et al., 2024).SAR:  disruption of any of the three disulfide bonds substantially reduced the peptide activity of AOD-1 or made AOD-2 and AOD-3 peptides inactive (Mao et al., 2024). AOD-2: C4 changed to S4; AOD-3: C11 changed to S11 and C33 to S33. Warning: Helix-inducing TFE could cause CD curve changes different from those observed in membrane-mimetic SDS micelles.Updated 7/2021; Jan2024; 10/2024",
