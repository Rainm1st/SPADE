  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Active against primarily G+ bacteria such as S. aureus (MIC 50 uM). Also, this peptide stimulated the rate of insulin release from BRIN-BD11 clonal beta cells at a concentration of 30 nM (p < 0.05) with a response of 296 Â± 26% of basal release at 3 ?m (p < 0.001) (Ojo et al., 2013), thereby of interest for type 2 diabetes (T2D).Structure: It is helical in 50% TFE. Three years later, several peptide mutants were made to modulate peptide properties.SAR: While increase in cationic amino acids increases antimicrobial activity as well as cytotoxicity, incorporation of D-amino acids improved peptide selectivity (Conlon JM et al., 2012). Incorporation of a Trp enhanced anticancer and hemolytic activity. However, introducing D-Lys11 into the peptide made it more cell selective (Conlon et al., 2013).  Updated 11/2012, 12/2018 GW.",
