  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Optimal production condition: incubation in tryptic soy broth for 24-48 h at 35oC.Molecular form: There are two forms of SA: cell associated (SA-CA) and secreted to extracellular (SA-EX). They have the same activity spectrum. Amino acid sequence was reported in 1993 (Hynes et al., 1993).Activity: active against S. agalactiae, S. equi, Group E streptococcus, Group G streptococcus, Group L streptococcus, S. cremoris, S. lactis, C. xerose, C. ovis, M. lysodeikticus, M. roseus, S. lutea, B. cereus, B. subtilis, S. citreus, and Group A streptococcus PF 1643. Not active against S.faecalis, S.aureus strains C55 and 502A, E.coli.Antimicrobial robustness: killing: exponetial phase > stationary phase. Sensitive to proteolytic enzymes (protease-sensitive). activity is temperature-sensitive with more killing at 37oC but reduced killing at lower temperature 25oC and 4oC.MOA: inhibited the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein.Gene duplication product: streptococcin A-M49 is also expressed in some strains via gene duplication. streptococcin A-M49 shares the same amino acid sequence with ScnA, differingly in four amino acids only in the leader sequence.
