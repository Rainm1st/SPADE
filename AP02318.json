    "Literature": "Activity: Active against S. aureus (MIC 5-10 uM), S. epidermidis (MIC 1.25-2.5 uM), E. faecalis (MIC 10 uM),  K. pneumoniae (20 uM),  P. aeruginosa (20 uM), A. baumannnii (5-10 uM), S. maltophilia (5-10 uM), E. coli (MIC 10 uM), and C. albicans (80 uM). The peptide is also activ eagainst select cancer cell lines (A549, MDA-231, HT-29, and HUVEC) (LC502.5-9.5 uM).Toxicity:  It is also moderate hemolytic (LC50 28 uM)(Mechkarska M et al. 2014).Structure:  The peptide is helical in 50% TFE and possesses insulin-releasing activity, thereby promising for treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) (Manzo G et al., 2016).
