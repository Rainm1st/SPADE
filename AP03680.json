    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (95.83%) toBrevinin-1-AWL: 21%; A: 17%; I=K: 13%. GRAVY: 1.125; M Wt:  2614.343; Mol formula: C124H210N30O26S2; molar extinction coeff: 125.Activity: active against Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 6538 or MRSA NCTC 12493 (MIC 8 uM), E. faecalis NCTC 12697 (MIC 16 uM), Gram- E. coli ATCC 8739 (MIC 8 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC 43816 (MIC 8 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027 (MIC 16 uM)), C.albicans ATCC 10231 (MIC 256 uM). It killed S. aureus at 2xMIC in 60 min. It also showed biofilm inhibitory activity (MBIC 16 uM) against S. aureus but was unable to disrupt biofilms (MBEC > 256 uM). This peptide inhibits cancer cell proliferation.Structure: random coil in 10 mM NH4Ac buffer, but became helical (36.2%) in 50% TFE.MOA:bacteria: the peptide was able to permeate S. aureus membranes.Toxicity: the peptide is toxic: hemolytic HC50 10.6 uM: highly hemolytic. Also HACaT cells (IC50 20.53 uM) and HMEC (IC50 26.45 uM).",
