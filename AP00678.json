  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "In some reports, the peptide is represented as a 42-mer by including an additional segment KKID. However, a 38-mer is present in neutraphil. Further, this 38-mer dog cathelicidin shows sequence homolog to human LL-37, indicating that the 3D structure of human LL-37 may be applied as a model to understand its function. Synthetic K9CATH displayed broad antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (L. monocytogenes, and S. aureus; MICs (minimal inhibitory concentrations) 0.5 and 50 uM, respectively), Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. serotype Typhimurium, P. aeruginosa, P. mirabilis; MICs 1.25 uM, S. serotype Enteritidis; MIC 0.5 uM, and N. gonorrhoeae; MIC 0.06 uM), and yeast (C. albicans; MIC 12.5-50 uM).",
