    "Literature": "Peptide design: LLAA was obtained by reversing the core antimicrobial peptide (residues 17-29) of LL-37.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (42.86%) toaurein 1.2.  R: 23%; I=F=K: 15%. GRAVY: -0.44; M Wt: 1719.106; M formula: C80H135N25O17, mol ex coeff: 0.Activity: active against E. coli (MIC 20 uM).Structure: a helical structure for residues 4-12 was found in complex with SDS micelles. Hence, the helical structure is retained after sequence reversal.Updated 7/2024",
