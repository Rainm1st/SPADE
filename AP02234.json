  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Highly active against S. aureus (MIC 2.5 uM), E. coli (MIC 5 uM) and C. albicans (MIC 2.5 uM). The increase in both basic and hydrophobic amino acids made this peptide more active against pathogens and more toxic to mammalian cells.  Also anticancer: IC50 values of 1.5 uM (H157), 1.6 uM (H838), 1.8 uM (MCF-7), 2.1 uM (PC3) and 2.9 uM (U251-MG).Toxicity: complete hemolysis at 20 uM. Hence,highly hemolytic. The original entry for the natural parent peptide TsAP-1 (seq: FLSLIPSLVGGSISAFK) was replaced with its active analog in 11/2021. Updated 7/2021",
