    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: Most similar (80.76%) toP. sarana Hepcidin.Activity: Active against Gram- E. tarda (MIC 2 uM), V. anguillarum (MIC 4 uM), Gram+ S. aureus (MIC 2 uM) and M. luteus (MIC 1 uM).Animal model: fish: In vivo efficacy against bacteria and viruses was also observed. Fish treated with SmHep2P displayed moderate but significantly lower viral amounts in all tissues compared to fish treated with SmHep1P, suggesting that SmHep2P was more effective than SmHep1P in blocking megalocytivirus infection.
