  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "The sequence contains 21% leucines, 15% glycines, serines, and lysines. Active against S. aureus (MIC 66 uM) and E. coli (MIC 33 uM).  Helical in TFE and liposomes. Also, this peptide can inhibit  acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme involved in non-cholinergic processes as the stimulation of the amyloid-beta peptide aggregation and neurotoxicity (Sanchis et al., 2020).
