  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar to (76.67%) toLacticin 3147C: 14%.Chemical modification: for chain A: four thioether bonds between residues 1-2, 9-19, 20-25, and 22-29. Residues 3 and 5 are dehydrated (XXW). residue 7 is a D-amino acid.  For chain B (sequence WTPALSVITGYISSNTCPTTACTRAC): three thioether bonds and two dehydrated at residue 2 and 9, two D-amino acids: residues 6 and 9.Activity: agar diffusion: active against B. cereus 14579, L. monocytogenes LMG10470, M. flavus NIZO B423, L. lactis NZ9000, E. faecium LMG 16003, and S. aureus LMG 15975 MRSA but not against any of the tested Gram-negative bacteria.Synergy:AMPs: The two polypeptide chains work synergistically.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: each peptide was expresed for activity test.",
