  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "This study used the Lynn's definition (2004 Immunogenesis 56:170, where this peptide is called Gal4). In the recommended Xiao's nomenclature (2004 BMC Genomics 5:56), it is Gal6. The disulfide bonds did not appear to be important as the two forms of the peptide expressed with or without the S-S bond showed similar activity against bacteria (Cao Y. et al. 2012 Protein Pept Lett). The peptide was also active when expressed as a GST fusion. It is 100% conserved in chicken, geese, and ducks (Peng KS et al. 2013 Poult Sci). Found in multiple species. Updated 4/2012; 12/2012 GW.",
