    "Literature": "Activity: Active against Gram- P-aeruginosa (MIC >20.8 uM), E. coli (MIC 20.8 uM), Gram+ B. subtilis (MIC 5.2 uM), S. epidermidis (MIC 5.2 uM), S. aureus (MIC 2.6 uM), E. faecalis (MIC 1.3 uM), and yeast C-albicans (MIC >20.8 uM).Toxicity:  little hemo-lytic (1.4% at 44.5 uM).Structure: Helical in 60% TFE or 120 mM DPC micelles. NMR structure in DPC: It consists of two helical regions  (3-18 and 20-39) separated by a coiled region.  In contrast, Pandinin 2 is composed of an all helical structure, which is toxic to mammalian cells. Updated 5/2015; 7/2021",
