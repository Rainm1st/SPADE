    "Literature": "Active against fungi A. longipes (50% inhibition IC50 6 ug/ml), B. cinerea (IC50 6 ug/m), C. sphaerospermum (IC50 3 ug/m), F. culmorum (IC50 6 ug/m), P. digitatum (IC50 3 ug/m), T. viride (IC50 12 ug/m), and V. alboatrum (IC50 6 ug/m).  Salt-sensitive: 50% inhibition concentration increased dramatically to the range of 100 to >200 ug/ml when the medium was supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2 and 50 mM KCl. The N-terminal glutamine is believed to be cyclized (i.e., pyroglutamate, XXQ). It contains two disulfide bonds (6-16 & 7-20). Updated 7/2021",
