    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (55.2%) toPalustrin-2AR.  Mol Wt: 2986.494; Mol formula: C131H220N33O40S2; Mol ex coeff.: 5675; GRAVY: 0.12;Activity: Active against the fungus C. albicans. Ranatuerin-2SSa was slightly active against plant pathogen C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis.  Moderate antioxidant activity (20 ug/mL at 21.9%).In vitro toxicity: The peptide is toxic to mammalian cells (32 ug/ml, survival rates of COS7, HepG2, and CPAE (38.3%, 19.7%, and 32.9%).  Peptide sequence kindly provided by Prof. Iwamuro.",
