    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE shows poor sequence similarity (21.8%) towasp OdVP3.Activity: Active against Gram- bacteria P.  stutzeri, P. fluorescens, A. hydrophila (MIC 0.63-2.5 uM), Gram+ M. luteus, S. aureus, C. glutamicum, M. lysodeikticus (MIC 0.63-5 uM), and yeast P. pastoris GS115 (MIC 2.5-5 uM). Domain activity: PRD is more active than CRD. With the challenge of either Vibrio parahaemolyticus or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), SpHyastatin showed a positive response. The putative NF-kB element acted as a positive regulatory element for this peptide.  Knocking  down  SpHyastatin  transcription  results  in  the  reduction  of  crab survival rate when challenged with V. parahaemolyticus (Shan et al., 2016). Updated 10/2020",
