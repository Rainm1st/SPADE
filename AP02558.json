    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence  of this peptide shows poor similarity (24.5%) toIm-1.  This is a two-domain protein: N-terminal domain OtTx1a-AMP and C-terminal domain OtTx1a-ICK. The N-terminal helical domain contains the major antimicrobial region.Activity: Full length and N-terminal domain are active against A. globiformis VKM Ac-1112 (MIC 0.6-1.25 uM), B. subtilis VKM B-501 (0.12-0.25 uM), and E. coli DH5alpha (MIC 0.12-0.25 uM). The full length is not as active as the N-terminal domain (OtTx1a-AMP) in inhibiting P. aeruginosa PAO1. In addition, OtTx1a-AMP is also active against E. faecalis VKM B-871 (MIC 5-10 uM), and S. aureus 209P (MIC 0.6-1.25 uM).Structure:  helical in TFE or SDS. Also, the N- and C-terminal domains were studied by NMR. The N-terminal 41 residues contain a helix-hinge-helix motif, while the C-terminal domain contains disulfide stabilized knottin motif (Shemyakin et al. 2017). Updated 12/2016; 12/2024.",
