    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (50%) toBalteatideR: 29%; I=L=A=W=K: 14%.  GRAVY: -0.528; M Wt: 1866.331; Mol formula: C88H150N30O15; molar extinction coeff: 11100.Activity: active against S. aureus MSSA or MRSA many strains (MIC 2-4 uM) and S. epidermidis (MIC 2 uM). Also antibiofilms.Antimicrobial robustness: MIC remained essentially the same in the presence of 100 mM NaCL (salt-insensitive): NaCl-insensitive:S. aureus.  MgCl2-insensitive:S. aureus (2 mM physiological). In addition, there is no significant difference in killing up to 150 mM NaCl.Structure: helical in 50% TFE, SDS or DPC (CD). NMR structural determination in DPC found a central helix covering residues R4-K13 (Kao et al., 2022).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure of this defensinherein the PDB.Toxicity: low level (~10%) hemolysis at 300 uM. low hemo.lytic. Not toxic to Hela cells at 4-8-fold antimicrobial concentrations.DNA binding: gel retardation.Synergy:AMPs: it enhanced the killing of lysostaphin over 1000 fold. Updated 11/2023",
