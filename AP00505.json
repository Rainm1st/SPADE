  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: Histatin 5 is a proteolytic product of histatin 3.Activity: Active against C. albicans. Also  killing ESKAPE pathogens, such as S. aureus or MRSA, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii, E. cloacae,  and E. faecium (Du H et al., 2017). Also active against bacteria A.actinomycetemcomitans (ED50 >100 uM),  S. mutans cariogenic bacteria (ED50 92 uM),  fungi C. albicans DIS or azole resistant (ED50 6.40-6.68 uM), C. glabrata or fluconazole resistant(ED50 38.7-85.3 uM),  C. krusei (ED50 6.47 uM), and C. neoformans CN2 or amphotericin B resistant (ED50 3.71-3.72 uM), and S. cerevisiae (MIC 74 uM) (Data from ref for AP504).  It also inhibits intracellular L. donovani (Luque-Ortega et al., 2008).Structure:  disordered in water and adopted a helical conformation in DMSO or TFE (Brewer et al., 1998;Raj al., 1998; ).Derivatives: The active domain of histitin 5 (Dh-5) corresponding to residues 11-24 showed HIV inhibitory effects. However,the results with  the Dh-5 mutants are mixed (Groot et al. 2006 J. Virol. 80: 9236-9243). The sequence of Dhvar4 is KRLFKKLLFSLRKY, a helical peptide which is active against bacteria and fungi. Dhvar5 has a sequence LLLFLLKKRKKRKY, which is active against bacteria and fungi (Ruissen AL et al 2002 Peptides 23:1391-9). P-113 (P113) is a 12-residue active peptide corresponding to residues 4-15 of histatin 5 (Rothstein DM et al. 2001 AAC 45: 1367). Both the D and L forms (D=L) were equally active against C. albicans, but only the D-form (P113-D) was active in vivo (Sajjan US et al 2001 Antimicrob Agents Chemother 45:3437-3444). The His-His sequence is a good ligand for Cu2+ (Kulon K et al. 2008 J Inorg Biochem 102: 960-72). Enzyme inhibitor: Hst 5 is a competitive cysteine proteinase inhibitor (Gusman H et al., 2001). Derivatives were subjected to clinical trials.Surface immobilized peptide: Dhvar5 has been covalently immobilized 2015 to chitosan film at 2 ng/cm2 and can decrease MRSA (MIC 0.5 ug/ml) colonization: adhesion (Costa FM et al. 2015).
