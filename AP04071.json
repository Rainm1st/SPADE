GRAVY: -0.6725; mol Wt: 4417.049; mol formula: C191H284N53O54S6; mol ex coeff: 10395.Activity: active against Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 25923 or ATCC 6538 or MRSA ATCC 43300 (MIC 0.028-0.114 uM), S. suis CVCC3309 or CVCC3928 or CVCC606 (MIC 0.028 uM), S. pneumoniae CVCC1.8722 or CVCC2350 (MIC 0.454-0.909 uM), Gram- S-enteritidis CMCC50336 (MIC> 7.273 uM), S-typhimurium ATCC14028 (MIC> 7.273 uM), S-choleraesuis CVCC503 (MIC> 7.273 uM), S-pullorum CVCC1789 (MIC> 7.273 uM), and E-coli CVCC195 or CICC21530 (MIC> 7.273 uM) (Chen et al., 2017). Also: S. pseudintermedius CGMCC 1.90024 or CGMCC 1.90005 (MIC 0.23 uM), anti-biofilms:bacteria:S. pseudintermedius (Zhang et al., 2024).MOA:bacteria: S. pseudintermedius:  acted on bacterial membranes.In vivo PK:mice:IP/IV/SC:  t1/2 were 0.38 h, 0.62 h, and 1.0 h after s.c. injection of 10, 40, and 160 mg/kg, respectively (Andes et al., 2009).Animal model:mouse: a mouse pyoderma model : reduced bacterial burden and damge in skin.Recombinant production:yeast:Pichia pastoris: expressed and purified in a fermentor.Peptide formulation: loaded into hydrogel speeds up S. aureus infected wound, angiogenesis, and promoting  the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), endothelial growth factor (EGF) (Huang et al., 2022).Application: animal feed: a mutant strain of Tetraselmis subcordiformis (a unicellular marine green alga) containing AMP NZ2114 was developed and used as an oral drug delivery system to reduce the use of antibiotics in turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) aquaculture. Outcomes: bacterial control, immune regulation, and microbiota regulation (Yao et al., 2024).Updated 7/2024; 4/2025",
