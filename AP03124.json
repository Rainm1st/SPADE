    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (43.5%) toscorpion HgebetaKTx. Mol Wt:  6638.867; GRAVY: -0.52; Mol Formula: C280H468N82O83S97, mol ex coeff: 3355.Activity:  Active against E. coli.Structure:  This is a two-domain beta-KTx peptide. While the N-terminal domain is helical, the C-terminal domain is disulfide bond containing defensin-like. It is the first example of insecticidal toxin in this family. Antibacterial and insecticidal activity is located at the N-terminus, which is less toxic than the full length peptide (Juichi et al., 2018).  Note taht the N-terminal helical fragment (in 50% TFE by CD) is more active against E. coli. Since the full length peptide is evolved to be more potent in killing insects, this activity may be the major biological function. The 3D structure has been determined by NMR (Tamura et al., 2022).
