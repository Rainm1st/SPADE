    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide shows poor similarity (31.9%) toAcidocin A.  A synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 21 amino acids is membrane active and can inhibit the growth of A. globiformis Ac-1112 and B. subtilis B-501 (MIC 3.1-6.2 uM). The gram stain of this bacterium can change from negative (growth early stage) to positive (30 h later).",
