Activity against Gram- bacteria not detected at 32 uM (MIC >32 ug/ml).Animal model:mouse:  When 10 mg/kg eurocin was administered, viable S. pneumoniae in the peritoneum of mice dropped by approximately 3 orders of magnitude after 2 h.  The polypeptide fod is similar to plectasin.Structure:You can rotate, zoom, and view the crystal structureherein the PDB.  Updated Jan2013; Jan2015.",
