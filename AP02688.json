  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE shows 46% similarity toBACTERIOCIN AN5-2.Discovery: Griselimycin was initially found in the 1960s (Terlain B, Thomas JP. Bull Soc Chim Fr. 1971 Jun;6:2349-56).Chemical modification:SAR: The full synthetic derivatives (MGM and CGM) are better suited as a possible candidate to treat susceptible and resistant M. tuberculosis (anti-TB). MGM is a derivative with Pro8 methylated, while CGM is a derivative with Pro8 cyclohexylated.MOA:  It works by inhibiting the DNA polymerase sliding clamp DnaN (4 crystal structures of the complex have been deposited into the PDB).Structure:You can rotate, zoom, and view one of the 3D structuresherein the PDB.Animal model:mouse:  CGM showed in vivo efficacy in a mouse model of TB.
