  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (46.67%) toPd_mastoparan PDD-AV: 38%.Chemical modification: T1 dehydrated (Dhb); R3=ornithine; N-terminus is acylated with 2-hydroxy-3-methylvaleric acid (lipo), the lipoinitiation of bogorols is mediated by the module encoded by bogJ.; In addition, R3 is a D-aa and also succinylated! Y11 is also a D-aa;Activity:  active against X. campestris pv. campestris NCCB92058 (MIC 4 ug/ml), X. translucens pv. graminis LMG587 (MIC 8 ug/ml), P. syringae pv. antirrhini LMG2131, P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (MIC 16 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa PAO1 (MIC 32 ug/ml), K. pneumoniae LMG20218 (MIC 16 ug/ml), E. coli ET8 or MG1665 (MIC 8-16 ug/ml),  P-carotovorum LMG5863 (MIC>32  ug/ml), R-syzygii subsp. syzygii LMG6969 (MIC >32  ug/ml), S. aureus subsp. aureus 533 R4, B. cereus ATCC 14579 (MIC 2  ug/ml), E. faecium LMG16003 (MIC 4  ug/ml).MOA:  It penetrates bacterial outer and inner membranes.SAR:  the activity of Bogorol K may be regulated by succinylation of O3, leading to Succilin K. Succinylation decreases the peptide activity due to the conversion of a basic amino acid into an acidic aa. As a consequence, Succilin K cannot penetrate bacterial outer and inner membranes.",
