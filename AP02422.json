  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Molecular form: Dimer was observed using non-reducing SDS-gel.Activity: Active against fungi A. niger, strain VKM F-2259 (IC50 18.5 uM), A. versicolor, strain VKM F-1114 (IC50 18.5 uM), B. cinerea, strain VKM F-3700 (IC50 9.25 uM), F.  culmorum, strain VKM F-844 (IC50 18.5-37 uM), and N. crassa, strain VKM F-184 (IC50 9.25-18.5 uM).Structure: Structure was determined by NMR. There are one helical region (residues N21-K27) and three beta strands (K1-L6, S32-C35, and C41-C47).You can rotate, zoom, and view the NMR structure 2LJ7herein the PDB. However, no spin systems were found for residues C14-C20, probably due to micro-ms time scale motion in the loop regions, which may be involved in membrane targeting. Updated Jan2015.",
