    "Literature": "Constitutively expressed in plant tissues.Activity: Active against bacteria C. michiganensis (EC50=4 uM), R. solanacearum (rfa-) (EC50=15 uM), fungi B. cinerea (EC50=0.8 uM), F. solani, F. culmorum (EC50 2 uM), F. oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans, F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (EC50 13 uM), P. cucumerina (EC50 10 uM), C. graminicola (EC50 20 uM), C. lagenarium (EC50 10 uM), B. maydis, and A. flavus (EC50 20 uM).Transgenic plants: Overexpression of snakin-1 gene enhances resistance to Rhizoctonia solani and Erwinia carotovora in transgenic potato plants (Mol Plant Pathol. 2008 May;9(3):329-38).Structure: Crystal structure has been sovled using Racemic Protein Crystallography.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. There are also other structures in the PDB. The crystal structure reveals a unique protein fold with six disulfide crosslinks, presenting a distinct electrostatic surface that may target the protein to microbial cell surfaces (Yeung H et al., 2016).Recombinant production:yeast:Pichia pastoris:  it has also been expressed in E. coli and insects. Recombinant production:yeast:bacteria:Escherichia coli; Recombinant production:insects:Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9).Updated 10/2016; 7/2021 GW.",
