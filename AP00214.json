    "Literature": "Activity: Active against Gram- S. typhimurium LT2 or 1102 (MIC 0.8-3.1 ug/ml), E. coli K12 (MIC 1.6-3.1 ug/ml), S. Minnesota 1114W or R595 (MIC 1.6-3.1 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa (MIC 12.5 ug/ml), Gram+ S. aureus 209P or ATCC 25923 (MIC 3.1-6.3 ug/ml), B. subtilis (MIC 3.1 ug/ml), C. albicans M9 (MIC 3.1 ug/ml), and C. neoformans IMF 40040 (MIC 1.56 ug/ml). It also inhibits HIV by binding to gp120 and CD4. More active against a mprF mutant strain (Peschel  et al., 2001).Resistance development:yes:bacteria:A. hydrophila XS91-4-1i:  Resistance development:yes:bacteria:E. coli ATCC 25922; Resistance development:yes:bacteria:P. aeruginosa CGMCC1.2620. Resistance was observed (Hong et al., 2016).Structure: Two disulfide bridges: 3,16; 7,12; beta hairpin conformation in DPC micelles (in water, PDB ID 1WO0).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Structure bound to LPS is here. Structure-activity relationship study improved peptide therapeutic index and reveals the importane of the beta-strands for stability (Edwards et al. 2017).MOA:bacteria:  it acts on bacterial membranes by forming a pore. Tac appears to influence the pathway underlying unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis related to membrane function (Liu et al., 2018).Antiviral: It inhibits HSV-1, HSV-2 (Yasin et al., 2000), an enveloped DNA virus of Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) and a non-enveloped RNA virus of viral nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) (Xie H et al., 2016).MOA:virus:  Its anti-HIV activity may be due to the inhibition of virual adsorption to cells (Morimoto et al 1991 Chemotherapy 37:206-11). Transgenic plants: expression of this peptide in patato improves resistance to pathogens (Montesinos E 2007 FEMS Microbiol Lett 270, 1-11).Surface immobilized peptide: The peptide has been expressed as a fusion protein and coated to haloarchaea-produced poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBHV) via hydrophobic interaction (Xue et al., 2018). Found in multiple species. Ref Updated 12/2012; 2/2014; 11/2015; 9/2016; 5/2018; 4/2019; 7/2021; Jan2024",
