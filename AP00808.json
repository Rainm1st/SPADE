  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Active against two seabream isolates Pdp11 (IC50 2.2 uM), 51M6 (IC50 14.61 uM) (both isolates belonging to the genus Shewenella), B. subtilis CECT 35 (IC50 11.41 uM) and E. coli DH5alpha (IC50 18.66 uM). IC50 is the concentration for 50% growth inhibition after 12 h incubation. The viability of V.anguillarum R-82, P.damselae damselae and L.delbrueckii lactis strains was unaffected by the peptide even up to concentrations of 200 uM. This peptide has been detected in different fish (Yang, M et al. 2011 Comp Biochem Physiol B Biochem Mol Biol. 158(2):155-63). Found in multiple species. Updated 7/2021",
