    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (52.38%) toP-04. L: 26%, K: 16%. Discovered from the human unconventional myosin 1h protein by computer prediction.Activity: active against S. aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC 4 uM), S. epidermidis (MIC 5.33 uM), fungi T. rubrum (MIC 32 uM), and C. albicans (MIC 8 uM).Toxicity: human RBC: HC50 64 uM. hemolytic.Structure: it became helical after binding to lipids. More helical in the presence of anionic DMPG (91.3%) than DMPC (50.8%).",
