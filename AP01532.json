    "Literature": "First isolated from the gut of L sericata larvae. Also detected in salivary glands, fat body and haemolymph (provided by the authors). Active against M. luteus. Lucifensin adopts a characteristic insect defensin structure that\nincludes an alpha helix (residues 13-23) and a pair of beta-strands (residues 28-31 and 34-38) (Nygaard et al. 2012 J. Biomol.
