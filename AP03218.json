  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (55%) toBrevinin-1SPb.Activity: Active only against the tested Gram+ bacteria, including S. aureus ATCC25923 (MIC 4.68 ug/mL), S. aureus 090223+ (IS) and N. asteroids 090312+ (IS) (MIC 37.5 ug/mL).SAR: Without C-terminal amidation (with S-S bond), the peptide lost activity. Without the Rana box (with amidation), the peptide became less active (MIC 37.5-75 ug/mL).Structure: However, all the peptide analogs remain helical in 50% TFE water solution.Toxicity: Little hemolysis at 100 ug/mL. Hemolysis of human RBC increased without C-terminal amidation (15.4%), Rana box (17.9%), or both (20.8%).",
