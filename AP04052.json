    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (68.97%) toranatuerin-2-AWK: 23%; L=A: 18%. GRAVY: 0.327; mol Wt: 2359.933; mol formula: C108H193N27O27S1; mol ex coeff: 0.Activity: S. aureus NCTC 10788 or MRSA (MIC 2 uM), E. coli ATCC 8739 (MIC 2 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC 43816 (MIC 4 uM), E. faecium NTCC 12697 (MIC 4 uM), and P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027 (MIC 8 uM). Good at biofilm inhibition but poor at eradication. Effective against multiple cancer cell lines (IC50 3.671-12.40 uM).Toxicity: horse RBC: low hemo.lytic (HC50> 128 uM).MOA:bacteria: Showed membrane permeabilization: E. coli, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa.Structure: became helical in 50% TFE.Animal model:wax moth: 10 mg/kg peptide is not toxic (no death). It protected animals by increasing their survival from 2 days (no treatment) to 5 days (5 mg/kg) to more than 5 days (10 mg/kg).",
