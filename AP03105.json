    "Literature": "Host expression: highly expressed in tissues such as the intestine, liver, spleen, and thymus. Expression is pig strain dependent and increased upon E. coli challenge.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (50%) tohuman DEFB114. GRAVY: -0.53; Mol. Wt.: 5552.485; Mol formula: C236H382N66O74S7; Mol Ex. coeff.: 4845.Activity: Active against E. coli DH5alpha or K88+ (MIC 11.5-23 uM), S.typhimurium ATCC14028 (MIC >512 ug/ml or 92 uM), Streptococcus, S.aureus CICC10384 (MIC >512 ug/ml), and B.subtilis (MIC>512 ug/ml), and fungus P.pastoris X33 (512 ug/ml).Toxicity: porcine RBC:less than 3.9% hemolysis up to 256 ug/ml: little hemo.lytic. Also, poorly cytotoxic to IPEC-J2 cells below 256 ug/ml.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: The peptide was recombinantly expressed E. coli Origami B (DE3) and tested.Updated 7/2021",
