  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "The amino acid sequence has been corrected based on a recent study (Kaur et al., 2016). This peptide is active against E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium. MOA: It targets bacterial membranes and induces ion channel formation, leading to the disruption of the proton-motive force and hence ATP production. 2016 paper was provided by Kamaljit Kaur. Seq. corrected and updated 5/31/2016. Updated 10/2016; 7/2022",
