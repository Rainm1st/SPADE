  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence  is 21% similar toCrustacean PtALF3. Active against Gram-positive S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, B. anthracis, and P. aeruginosa (Wu Y et al., 2010). Antibacterial effect against P. aeruginosa using recombinant protein was not affected by high salt concentrations (salt-insensitive) (Dubouix A et al., 2003). The positive charge of the protein is demonstrated to be important for binding to negatively charged cell wall of S. aureus (Koprivnjak T et al., 2002).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. Of outstanding interest is Pseudomanas aeruginosa can induce the expression of sPLA2-IIA that is sufficient to kill S. aureus in CF airways. This discovery explains the shift of the predominant bacterium in CF lung from S. aureus observed in young patients to Pseudomanas aeruginosa in adults (Pernet E et al., 2014). Additional data are required how these bacteria escape the killing of human AMPs. In the early stage, S. aureus appears to use adenosine to inhibit phagocytosis and sPLA2-IIA expression (Pernet E eta l., 2015).  Animal model:mouse: Instillation of recombinant sPLA2-IIA to infected mice can circumvent inhibition of endogenous sPLA2-IIA expression by anthrax toxins, thereby protecting mice from death due to B. anthracis infection.
