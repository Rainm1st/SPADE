    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide shows poor similarity (33.3%) toScorpion Hp 1090. Mol Wt: 1044.239; GRAVY: 0.025. The smallest plantaricin identified so far, produced by a key probiotic bacterium.Activity: This bacteriocin exhibited broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, especially Bacillus spp., high thermal stability (20 min, 121Â°C) and narrow pH stability (pH 2.0-7.0). These include B. cereus (MIC 16 uM), B. pumilus (MIC 16 uM), B. megaterium (MIC 16 uM), B. coagulans (MIC 16 uM), B. subtilis (MIC 16 uM), G. stearothermophilus (MIC 32 uM), A. acidoterrestris (MIC 16 uM),  P. polymyxa (MIC 16 uM), C. difficile (MIC 32 uM), C. perfringens (MIC 32 uM), C. sporogenes (MIC 32 uM), S. aureus (MIC 16 uM), M. luteus (MIC 16 uM), P. fluorescens (MIC 16 uM), S. marcescens (MIC 16 uM), E. coli (MIC 64 uM), S. enteritidis (MIC 16 uM), S. typhimurium (MIC 32 uM), S. paratyphi A (MIC 16 uM), S. paratyphi B (MIC 16 uM), S. flexneri (MIC 32 uM), and P. mirabilis (MIC 16 uM).  Plantaricin JLA-9 inhibited growth by preventing the establishment of oxidative metabolism and disrupting membrane integrity in germinating spores within 2 h. Thus, plantaricin JLA-9 has potential applications in the control of Bacillus spp. in the food industry. Updated 7/2021",
