  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: It differs from temporin A only at one residue (K vs. R).Chemical modification:  C-terminal amidated.Activity: Active against B. megaterium  and  E. coli B21 (MIC 64 uM), E.cloacae beta12 (MIC >128 uM), P.aeruginosa PA14 (MIC > 128 uM), S.epidermidis ATCC12228 (MIC >128 uM) (Bosquetti et al., 2024.  Also,  B. subtilis 3562 (MIC 80 ug/ml), A. oxydans 9333 (MIC ug/ml), C.albicans (MIC 320 ug/ml).Parasites: Also active against parasites  L. mexicana (Molecules. 2015 Feb 6;20(2):2775-85).Cancer: It showed antiproliferative activity to cancer cells: MCF-7 (IC50 49.75 uM) and MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer IC50 77.01 uM).In vitro toxicity: NOT HEMO.LYTIC at 100 uM (HC50 >> 100 uM).Structure: random coil in water and helical in SDS or TFE.SAR: This peptide (temporin F or DTF, CC50 92.4 uM) is slightly more toxic to  BALB 3T3 clone A31 cell line than temporin A (DTA, CC50 106.32 uM). The substitution of K7 with ornithine, or other amino acids with even shorter side chains led to reduced cytotoxicity (CC50 209.57-923.84 uM) to both normal cells and cancer cells (Dimitrova et al., 2024).Updated Jan2017; 7/2021; 10/2024",
