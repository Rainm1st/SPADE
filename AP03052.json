    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 89.7% similarity toPR-39.  Mol formula: C206H302N56O37; Mol Wt: 4155.03. GRAVY: -1.02.Activity:The antimicrobial activity of chemically synthesized PR-35 was similar to that of PR-39. Active against Gram- bacteria E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 3 ug/ml), S. typhimurium ATCC 14028 (MIC 2 ug/ml), P-aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC>32 ug/ml), S-aureus ATCC 25923, and B-cereus ATCC 10876 (MIC >32 ug/ml).Toxicity:  the level of mammalian cell cytotoxicity was lower than the wild type.
