    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: Shown is the sequence of chain A. The sequence of chain B is ALLHHGLNCAKGVLA, which is an N-terminally 3-residue truncated version of the chain A.Activity: active against S. aureus MRSA and P. aeruginosa.SAR:  while the homodimer of the 15mer is inactive, homodimer of the 18mer is active.Animal model:mouse:  a modified form of halocidin, with one additional lysine at the N-terminus of the long chain, is named as Khal, which is active against MRSA, VRE (anti-VRE) and L. monocytogenes in vitro. When treated intravenously, it showed ~1 log  CFU reduction in liver and spleen when L. monocytogenes was infected intravenously via the tail.
