  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Active against S. aureus (MIC 5 uM; MBC 10 uM), E.coli (MIC >320 uM). Active against C. albicans SC5314 (MIC 10-50 uM), C. tropicalis ATCC 750 (MIC 6.25 uM), C. parapsilosis ATCC22019 (MIC 100 uM), C. neoformans H99 serotype A (MIC 25 uM), and C. neoformans B3501 serotype D (MIC 12.5 uM). It also showed weak antibiofilmF activity against initial adherence of C. albicans at 100 uM but poor activity against the mature biofilm 400 uM (Guilhelmelli F et al., 2016).Structure: Predicted to be helical.Toxicity: not hemolytic at 15 uM, but it caused 50% hemolysis (HC50 at ~30 uM and 100% hemolysis at 80 uM (Hemolytic). Moderate hemolytic.Derivative: TsAP-S2 is a highly charged derivative with increased activity against Gram- bacteria.Found in multiple species.Updated 12/2016, 7/2021",
