    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (41.2%) toTemporin-ALk. Mol Wt: 1491.8; Mol formula: C75H114N18O14; Mol ex coeff.: 0; GRAVY: 1.03.Activity: Active against the fungus C. albicans. Granuliberin-SSa also showed activities that were almost equipotent to those of brevinin-2SSb against plant pathogens C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis and P. oryzae. The peptide was also active against X. oryzae pv. oryzae at concentrations higher than 64 ug/mL.  The peptide is toxic to mammalian cells (32 ug/ml, survival rates of COS7 and HepG2 (54.5% and 49.5%).  Peptide sequence kindly provided by Prof. Iwamuro.",
