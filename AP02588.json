    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide most resembles (97.6% similarity)Ticin A3. Active against the tested Gram-positive bacteria, including B. amyloliquefaciens, B. cereus, B. firmus, B. thuringiensis, B. subtilis, B. pumilus, E. faecalis, L. monocytogenes, Microbacterium, Paenibacillus, S. aureus, and S. sciuri. However, they are more active against food-borne pathogens such as B. cereus and L. monocytogenes. Chemical modifications such as dehydration are to be determined.",
