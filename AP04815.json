GRAVY: 1.27; mol Wt: 1988.404; mol formula: C94H154N24O23; mol ex coeff: 0.Activity: active against Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 6538 or MRSA NCTC 12493 (MIC 2-8 uM), Gram- E. coli ATCC 8739 (MIC 16 uM), A.baumannii BAA 747 (MIC > 128 uM),  K. pneumonia ATCC 43816 (MIC 64 uM), P.aeruginosa ATCC 9027 (MIC>128 uM), and fungi C. albicans (MIC 32 uM). Rapid killing at 2xMIC. It binds to LPS.  inhibit biofilms:bacteria (S. aureus and E. coli); eradicate preformed biofilms:S. aureus.Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-sensitive:S. aureus; KCl-sensitive:S. aureus; NH4Cl-sensitive:S. aureus;  CaCl2-sensitive:S. aureus; MgCl2-sensitive:S. aureus; FeCl3-sensitive:S. aureus. NaCl-sensitive:E. coli; KCl-insensitive:E. coli; NH4Cl-insensitive:E. coli;  CaCl2-sensitive:E. coli; MgCl2-insensitive:E. coli; FeCl3-insensitive:E. coli. serum-sensitive.MOA:bacteria:  it permeated bacterial membranes of S. aureus MRSA. Also permeated the outer membranes of E. coli.Structure: random coils in 10 mM NH4Ac and helical in 50% TFE.In vitro toxicity: horse RBC: HC50 64 uM.Animal model:wax moth: the peptide can protect insect Galleria mellonella from death caused by MRSA (died in 4 days at 16 mg/kg. cf. infected insects died in 2 days without treatment).",
