    "Literature": "Metal coordination: the N-terminal amine, the three imidazoles of H1, H6, and H9 participate in the coordination of Zn(II). No antibacterial activity was found in this study (Dudek et al., 2020).Activity: It inhibited the Human Herpes Virus type 1 (HHV-1) multiplication (Kuczer et al. 2011).  Active against Gram+ S. aureus ATCC25923 or penicillin-resistant (MIC 16-64 ug/ml), S. epidermidis penicillin-resistant (MIC 32 ug/ml), Gram- E. coli ATCC25922 or penicillin-resistant (MIC 8-16 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa ATCC27853 or penicillin-resistant (MIC 8-32 ug/ml), and K. pneumoniae ATCC13883 or penicillin-resistant (MIC 16 ug/ml) (Tu J et al., 2015).Animal model:mouse:  Peptide treatment led to induction of interferon in mice. Intranasal or S.C. injection administration (25 ug) of alloferon prevented mortality of most animals challenged with influenza virus A.Derivative: ZL-2 (sequence: HGVSGHGQHGTHG) was generated and was listed separately in the APD in 2024, see AP4592.Updated 12/2017; 6/2024.",
