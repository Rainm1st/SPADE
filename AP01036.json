    "Literature": "Discovery: also found Viola japonica in 2024 (Lian et al., 2024). Found in multiple species.Activity:  Active against S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 and E. coli in RDAs and MIC assays (Pränting M et al., 2010).  Moderately active against S. aureus (MIC 20-25 uM) and reduced bacterial load in vivo (Fensterseifer IC et al., 2014). Also, MIC against E. coli (20 uM), P. aeruginosa (10 uM), and C. albicans (20 uM) (Strömstedt AA et al., 2017). A. baumannii (MIC 4.2 uM) and B. subtilis (MIC 2.1 uM) (ref 2024). Also, plant fungi F. oxysporum (MIC 6-12.5 uM), B. cinerea (MIC 1.5 uM), F. graminearum (MIC 6.25 uM), F. culmorum (MIC 1.5 uM), C. utrechtense (MIC 6.25 uM), A. alternatam (MIC 1.5 uM) (Slazak et al. 2018). Active against nematode parasites (nematocidal) of sheep (e.g. Haemonchus contortus or Trichostrongylus colubriformis).SAR: A single glutamic acid plays a key role for the cytotoxicity: methylation leading to 48-fold decrease in activity. The 3 lysines are important in anthelmintic activity (Colgrave et al 2008 Chembiochem 9: 1939).MOA:This small cyclic plant protein exerts its effect on cell membranes and causes cancer cell lysis.Updated 7/22/10; 4/2017; 8/2019; 7/2021; 4/2024",
