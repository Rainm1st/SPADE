    "Literature": "Host expression:constitutively: Constitutively expressed.AMP significance and human disease: A reduced expression is observed in ileal Crohn's disease (Wehkamp J et al., 2005).Chemical modification: Three disulfide bridges.Activity: It had been puzzling regarding the role of this defensin. Recent studies revealed two mechanisms:First, HD-6 is a true AMP that kills bacteria under a reduced environmental conditions (2mM DTT in vitro) (Schroeder BO et al., 2014). In other words, disulfide bonds are not required for antimicrobial activity. Activity was observed against anaerobic gut commensals (B. adolescentis Ni3,29c, pH 7.4 only; L. acidophilus, B.  breve, B. longum, S. salivarius ssp thermophilus), but not against some pathogenic strains (E.coli, B.vulgatus, L.fermentum). An APD recommended reading.Second, HD6 is now shown to control enteric bacterial pathogens in vitro and in vivo by binding to bacterial surface proteins. The peptide appears to be able to form fibrils and nanonets that surround and entangle bacteria. These findings support a key role for HD6 in protecting the small intestine against invasion by diverse enteric pathogens and may explain the conservation of HD6 throughout Hominidae evolutionScience 2012.Structure: The self-assembly of HD-6 occurs in vivo requires\nhistidine-27 according to x-ray crystallographic studies.You can rotate, zoom, and view the crystal structure of the wild-type HD-6herein the PDB.You can also rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure of the His27 mutanthere.  However, you need look at the figures in the published paper for the crystal packing of the monomersScience 2012. HD6 forms amyloid structures at the gut mucosa with strong affinity for bacterial surfaces (Amyloid AMPs) (Bergman et al., 2016).APD update 6/2012; 2/2014; 2/2015; 10/2015; 3/2023; 12/2024. GW.",
