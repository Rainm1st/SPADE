    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (38.8%) toP11. Mol Wt:  2605.162; GRAVY:   -0.46; Mol Formula: C106H180N39O27S5, Mol ex coeff.: 7290.Activity: Active against Gram- E. coli D31, Pseudomonas sp.*, V. diabolicus, Vibrio MPV19 (MIC 0.012-0.096uM), Gram+ B. megaterium, and S. aureus (MIC 0.012-0.096 uM). This marine peptide has a very low MIC below 100 nM and its activity is salt-insensitive (a small effect, MIC only doubled +300 or 500 mM NaCl).Toxicity:  It is not hemo.lytic or cytotoxic to mammalian cells, a promising new peptide antibiotic.Structure:You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. 7/2021",
