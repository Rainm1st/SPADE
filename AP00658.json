    "Literature": "weakly active against S. aureus (MIC 70 uM) but not E.coli (MIC>150 uM) and C.albicans. The same sequence (Temporin 1VE) has also been reported byChen et al., 2006. In fact, the Chinese bamboo leaf odorous frog (Rana (Odorraana) versabilis) and North American Rana frogs share the same families of skin antimicrobial peptides. Found in multiple species.
