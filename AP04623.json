    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (96.43%) toDermaseptin-DI2A: 21%, L=K: 14%. Differing from AP00958 only at residue 9 (H vs. N). GRAVY: 0.164; mol wt: 2949.503; mol formula: C132H225N36O36S1; mol ex coeff: 5550.Activity: active against  S. aureus ATCC 12600 MRSA ATCC BAA-1720 (MIC 4-8 uM), E. faecalis ATCC 29212 (MIC 32 uM), E. coli ATCC 11755 (MIC 8 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 16 uM), and C. albicans ATCC 10231 (MIC 4 uM). MBC are the same or 2-fold higher, indicating bactericidal.In addition, it inhibited formation of biofilms:bacteria (MBIC: 4-64 uM) and disrupted preformed biofilms at higher concentrations (MBEC: 32-128 uM against these bacteria.Der-PS4 also inhibted the proliferation of cancer cells.In vitro toxicity: horse RBC: HC50 ~128 uM. It started to show hemolysis at 16 uM.MOA:bacteria: Also MOA:fungi:C. albicans: membrane permeated.Structure:  random coil in ammoniium acetate and helical in 50% TFE, PC/PG, or PE/PG vesicles (1:1).",
