    "Literature": "Activity: Active against Gram-negative bacteria Y. ruckeric NCIMB 2196 and P. immobilisc NCIMB 308 (MIC 2.5-5 uM). A recent study synthesized a peptide variant GAD-2 without the last two C-terminal residues (McDonald M et al., 2015). GAD-2 is much more active at slightly acidic pH. Both Gad-1 and Gad-2 demonstrated concentration-dependent cytotoxicity against LLC cells, HEY ovarian cancer cells, and PC3 prostate cancer cells. Helical in SDS. Structural heterogeneity is proposed. Updated 4/2015.",
