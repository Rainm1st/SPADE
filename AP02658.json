    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide most resembles (93.1% similarity)Cycloviolacin O22.  Mol. Wt: 2912.4; GRAVY=0.16. It inhibits Human Prolyl Oligopeptidase Activity (IC50 of 25 uM), a target for the cognitive deficits associated with several psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. cf. kalata B1 inhibited POP activity with an IC50 of 5.6 uM.",
