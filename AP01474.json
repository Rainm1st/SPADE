  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "N-terminal truncation enhances peptide antimicrobial activity. It showed a moderate activity against E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 46.5 ug/ml) and very weak activity against S. mutans NCTC 10449, L acidophilus NCTC 1723, E. faecalis NCTC 12697, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and C. albicans NCTC 3179 (MIC 125-280 ug/ml). Another study found MIC 20 ug/ml against A. simii, 25 ug/ml against C. albicans, and 30 ug/ml against C. neoformans  using synthetic peptide (Vouldoukis et aL., 1996). 3D structure was determined at pH 3.2 and 37oC by 2D NMR. Residues 13-36 form a well-defined amphipathic helix. Dimers co-exist in the NMR solution.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. Updated 5/2014; Jan2015; 5/2020.",
