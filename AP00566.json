    "Literature": "Activity: Active against M. luteus (MIC 1.9 uM), S. aureus (9.0 uM), B. subtilis (15.1 uM), S. epidermidis (18.1 uM), S. dysenteriae (18.1 uM), E. coli (4.5 uM), K. pneumoniae (4.5 uM),  and C. albicans (30.2 uM). Showed ~50% hemolysis at (100 ug/ml peptide to 2% hRBCs, v/v). The same amino acid sequence was also found byConlon JM et al. (2007)as Brevinin-2DYc from Rana dybowskii (Brevinin-2DYc/d is active against E. coli and S. aureus MIC 15 uM) and byLi A et al. (2013)as Brevinin-2RNa from Rana nigromaculata. Found in multiple species. Active against S. aureus, B. cereus, and S. lactis (MIC 37.5 uM), C. albicans (MIC 50 uM), and cancer cells MCF7 cells and Hela cells (IC50 ~50 uM).
