  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (96%) toMaximin 31G:24%; L:20%; A: 16%; K: 12%. Mol formula: C113H184N30O30; Mol Wt: 2442.88; Mol Ex Coeff: 0; GRAVY:  0.556. It differs from \tMaximin 31 only at position 9: F in this sequence vs. A.Activity:  Active against S. aureus (MIC 1.6 uM), MRSA (MIC 6.6 uM), E. coli (MIC 6.6 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 26.2 uM), and C. albicans (MIC 1.6 uM).Synergy:AMPs: It appears to show a synergistic antibacterial effect with Bombinin HL (inactive peptide MIC >100 uM).Toxicity: HC50: 50% hemolysis at 26.2 uM. At MIC 83.5-100% HMEC-1 cells remained viable.",
