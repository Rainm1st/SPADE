    "Literature": "Discovery: Mapped from cDNA and the exact natural form is yet to be identified.Activity: Zone inhibition assay: Active against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumonia, S. epidermidis,  P. mirabilis,  and  Streptococcus  group  D, fungi A.fumigatus (MIC 250 ug/ml) and C.albicans (MIC 1000 ug/ml). Bacteriocidal. Also active against E. coli KCTC 1682 (MIC 32 ug/ml), S. typhimurium KCTC 1926 (MIC 32 ug/ml),  B. subtilis KCTC 3068 (MIC 8 ug/ml), and S. aureus KCTC 1621 or 2 strains MRSA (MIC 16-64 ug/ml), 2 strains vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (MIC 32 ug/ml) anti-VRE. Non-standard assays in 50% LB (Yang et al., 2006.Antimicrobial robustness: MgCl2-sensitive:E. coli (2 mM); CaCl2-sensitive:E. coli (15 mM).Structure:   A unique strucure fold was determined by Schibli DJ, et al. (1999) Biochemistry 38: 16749.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Surface immobilized peptide: TBA.SAR: C-terminal amidation increased peptide activity by 2 fold in 50% LB (Yang et al., 2006). Two copies of the chain coupled with a lysine did not show any advantage in terms of antibacterial activity. Consecutive arginine residues on both the N- and C-terminals of this peptide appears to be essential for antibacterial activity of this synthetic peptide corresponding a portion of porcine C-terminal AMP sequence. The peptide remained active against bacteria after deleting the N-terminal 6 residues (Nagpal et al 1999 J Biol Chem 274: 23296-23304).Updated Jan2013; 2/2014; 6/2016; 5/2024; Jan2025.",
