    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (79.5%) toalphaS2 -casein151-181. It corresponds to residues 165-203 of alphaS2-casein (no corresponding protein in humans).Activity: Zone inhibition assay: A synthetic peptide is active against E. coli XL1 blue and BL21, as well as S. carnosus TM300s. Proposed to elicit a protective function of the mother mammary gland and the newborn intestine against pathogens.Structure: NMR structure in 50% TFE has been solved (Mercurio et al., 2019).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. 7/2021.",
