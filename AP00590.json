  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: It differs from Siamycin I only by one amino acid.  Siamycin I has a valine residue at position 4. In both peptides, disulfide bonds link Cys1 with Cys13 and Cys7 with Cys19, and the side chain of Asp9 forms an amide bond with the N-terminus (XXJ).Structure: determined in DMSO:H2O mixture (50:50), 335 NOE distance restraints were obtained, supporting a folded structure (Constantine et al., 1995).The original has been replaced since antimicrobial assays revealed no activity.
