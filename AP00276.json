    "Literature": "His content 17% (not His-rich based on >25%, thus classic).Activity: Active against E. coli  ML-35p,  L. monocytogenes  EGD  and  C. albicans  in  radial  diffusion  assays. Active against Gram+ S. aureus 930918-3 or ATCC 30371 or 28841 or MRSA, E. faecalis CDC 21, L. monocytogenes EGD (MIC 0.2-3.8 ug/ml), Gram-  E. coli mcr 106, E. coli BAS 849, S. typhimurium 14028S, S. typhimurium 7953S, K. pneumoniae 2270, P. aeruginosa SBI-N, P. aeruginosa MR2123, and P. aeruginosa MR3007 (MIC 0.4-2.1 ug/ml) (Lee IH et al., 1997).Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-sensitive:E. coli till 300 mM NaCl (Lee et al., 1997).Structure:  Helices were found between residues Phe2-His11 and Val16-His21 in TFE (Silva et al., 2016).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. Note: Structure not released since 2014 (last visited PDB 2023).MOA: Being His-rich, the peptide activity can be increased by 16 fold in the presence of Zinc (Zn2+) (Duay et al. 2019). Zinc binding can stabilize the helical structure and enhance membrane binding. Updated 7/2016; 3/2019; 7/2021; 7/2023",
