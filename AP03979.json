  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (77.78%) toHHC10W: 44%; R: 33%, K: 22%.Activity: active against 6 P. aeruginosa PAO1 or WT or resistant strains (MIC 0.3-5.7 uM), E. cloacae Strain C601 (MIC 11 uM), E. coli ESBL (MIC 3 uM), K. pneumoniae (MIC 22 uM), S. aureus ATCC 25923 or MRSA (MIC 1.4-3 uM), 5 E. faecalis ATCC29212 (MIC 1.1-43 uM) anti-VRE 2 strains =>174 uM (AMP-resistant?).SAR and peptide stability: incorporation of shorter cationic sidechains increased stability to trypsin (Bagheri  et al., 2016).Peptide formulation: it is absorbed onto the surface of TiO2 nanotube, which can effectively kill S. aureus. Peptide release depends on the crystalllinity of the TiO2 nanotubes (Ma et al., 2012). Other formulations have also been demonstrated.Surface immobilized peptide: This peptide has also been covalently immobilized on silicon surface with stable activity against E. coli, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa (He et al., 2018).
