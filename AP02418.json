Wt 1334.77 Da).Activity: Active against M. luteus 10209, S. carnosus LTH1502, S. citreus LC5, S. aureus D48, S. epidermidis Z80, L. plantarum ZJ317, L. monocytogenes LM1, E. coli DH5a, V. parahaemolyticus SCF16, S. flexneri DSM4782, and P. aeruginosa B2.Antimicrobial robustness: Stable to heat treatment (121 oC, 30 min) and pH 4.0â€“5.0, but not stable to a-Chymotrypsin, trypsin, papain, and pepsin although some stability to protease K was noticed.
