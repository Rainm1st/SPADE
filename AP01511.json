  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: Found bioinformatically and verified experimentally.  Found in multiple species.Synergy:AMPs:  This is a two-chain lantibiotic. Each chain is antimicrobial, but synergy appears when combined.Chemical modification:  It is predicted that thioether bridges form between residues 11 and 21, 22 and 27, and 24 and 31 in chain A1. The sequence of chain A2 is TTPATTSSWTCITAGVTVSASLCPTTKCTSRC (THE FIRST 6 RESIUDES were removed during post-processing). For chain A2, the predicted thioether bridges are 19-23, 25-28, and 29-32.Activity: It displayed antimicrobial activity against all Listeria monocytogenes, MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus strains tested. MIC reached the nM range. In addition, a similar peptide is reported inPLoS One. 2009 Aug 26;4(8):e6788. Inactivation of the lantibiotic modification enzymes licM1 and licM2 led to loss of antibacterial activity in the isopropanol extract.Structure:  NMR studies: chain A forms a folded non-alphabeta structure, while chain B is predominantly helical. Natural C13 NMR was found to be helpful (Shenkarev ZO et al 2010 Biochemistry 49: 6462-72).  Info formatted 2/2024",
