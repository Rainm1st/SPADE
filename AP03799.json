    "Literature": "Peptide design: obtained by replacing K25 of FK13-a1 with W.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (92.31%) toFK13-a1.  R: 33%; W: 23%; I: 15%. GRAVY: -0.41; M Wt: 1943.384; M formula:  C95H146N31O14, mol ex coeff: 16650.Activity: Active against E. coli KCTC 1682 (MIC 8 uM), P. aeruginosa KCTC 1637 (MIC 16 uM), S. typhimurium KCTC 1926 (MIC 4 uM), Gram+ B. subtilis KCTC 3068 (MIC 2 uM), S. epidermidis KCTC 1917 (MIC 8 uM), and  S. aureus KCTC1621 (MIC 2 uM). Non-standard assay: activity was measured in 1% peptone where LL-37 (control) is active against S. aureus.Toxicity: human RBC: HC50 12.5 uM, highly hemolytic.Structure: helical in 50% TFE.Anti-inflammatory: suppressed NO 100%, and TNF-alpha 75.6% (cf. LL-37: 100% and 90.4%, respectively).",
