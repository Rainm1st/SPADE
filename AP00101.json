    "Literature": "Chemical modification:  C-terminal amidated.Activity: Active against B. megaterium  and  E. coli (ref for AP00095). Active against parasites  L. mexicana (Molecules. 2015 Feb 6;20(2):2775-85).Synergy:antibiotics:     Giacometti et al (2006) found that the peptide showed the high activity when used with beta-lactams.MOA:bacteria: As the most active peptide in the temporin family, it may form pore-like openings on cellular membranes (Biochem J 2002; 368: 91-100).Structure: A helical structure was found by NMR studies in SDS and DPC micelles (Carotenuto et al. 2008. J Med Chem 51: 2354-62).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure bound to SDSherein the PDB.Antivirulence:bacteria:S. aureus: targeting virulence factors (Can√® et al., 2024).Synergy:AMPs:  Temporin L showed synergism with temporins A & B to inhibit LPS aggregation (J Biol Chem. 2006 Sep 29;281(39):28565-74).Peptide engineering: deployment of i, i+4 hydrocarbon stapling led to eTL [5-9] with similar activity but reduced toxicity and stable in serum.  eTL acted on membranes of MRSA.
