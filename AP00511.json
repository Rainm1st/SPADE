    "Literature": "Discovery: purified to >95% purity from the Roots of shepherd’s purse via acid extraction and chromatogrphic separation.Sequence analysis:  Shepherin I and Shepherin II are two unique gly-rich AMPs generated from the same precursor protein using different polypeptide regions. Due to multiple His residues, their net charge depends on pH.Activity: IC50: 50% reduction in CFU. active against Gram-  E. herbicola (IC50 62 ug/ml), E. coli (IC50 <2.5 ug/ml), P. putida(IC50 <2.5 ug/ml), P. syringae (IC50 <2.5 ug/ml), S.  typhimurium (IC50 <2.5 ug/ml), Serratia sp. (IC50 8 ug/ml),  Gram+ B.subtilis (IC50 >100 ug/ml), S.aureus (IC50 >100 ug/ml), S.mutans (IC50 >100 ug/ml), fungi C. albicans (IC50 8 ug/ml),  C. neoformans (IC50 <2.5 ug/ml),  S. cerevisiae (IC50 7 ug/ml),  A. alternata (IC50 7 ug/ml),  A. flavus (IC50 65 ug/ml),  A.fumigatus (IC50 >100 ug/ml), and F. culmorum (IC50 72 ug/ml). Also, a 2014 paper reported MIC against C. albicans MDM8 or  ATCC 90028 or fluconazole-resistant HU 168 (MIC 12.5-25 uM), C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019 (MIC 6.25 uM), C. krusei ATCC 6258 (MIC 50 uM), C. tropicalis Squibb 1600 (MIC 1.56 uM),  and S. cerevisiae ATCC 2601 (MIC 12.5 uM) (Remuzgo et al., 2014).SAR: C-terminal amidation showed little effect on this peptide antifungal activity. Amidated peptide showed killing effect.Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-sensitive:C. albicans MDM8 (34.3-137.0 mM).MOA:fungi: Zn2+ (10 uM) potentiated peptide antifungal activity (Remuzgo et al., 2014). The peptide changes structure in complex with Zn2+. The interaction with metal also causes the formation of fibril, which is antifungal. No anticandidal activity was found in the presence of Cu2+ or for the free peptide (Watly et al., 2023). The 2014 paper: Amidated peptide did not permeate fungal membranes.Structure:  In TFE, no ordered structure was found by CD.Entry history:  The original has been replaced.
