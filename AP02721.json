  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE shows 38.5% similarity tofish Pep39.  It inhibited the in vitro growth of X. axonopodis pv. glycines, the causative agent of the bacterial pustule disease, at 5 uM. Also active ex vivo and in vivo after vector transformation. It remains to be confirmed whether this AMP (exact region?) is expressed to protect soybeans from infection.",
