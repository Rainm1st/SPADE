    "Literature": "Activity: Active against E. coli (MIC 2.5 uM), S. aureus (MIC 80 uM), C.albicans (MIC 130 uM).   In addition, this peptide stimulated insulin release from the BRIN-BD11 clonal beta-cell line without increasing release of lactate dehydrogenase (Abdel-Wahab YH et al., 2008), thereby of interest for type 2 diabetes (T2D).Toxicity: HC50 RBC 300 uM: not hemo.lytic.Structure:  CD studies showed that the pseudins belong to amphipathic alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides (helical in 50% TFE).MOA:bacteria:  It probably interacts with membranes (pore formation) and also binds to RNA (inhibition of protein synthesis) (Park SC et al. 2010 BBA 1808 (1), 171-82).SAR:  The [Lys18] analogue was the most potent (46% increase in insulin release at 10(-9) M). Pse-T2 showed improved activity and reduced cytotoxicity (Kang et al., 2018).  12/2018; Jan2019; 5/2020.",
