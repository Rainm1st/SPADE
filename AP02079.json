    "Literature": "Activity: At 10 ug/ml, it killed 100% E. coli and 81% S. aureus. Also active against E. coli ML-35p (MIC 0.5 ug/ml) and L. monocytogenes  (MIC 3.6 ug/ml). Antimicrobial activity was also established by (Yang et al., 2003) against E. coli ~ S. aureus, S. pyogenes, B. anthracis, and P. aeruginosa.  It is also active against parasite L. mexicana in vitro (SÃ¶birk SK et al 2013). Ref updated 7/2014; 7/2017; 7/2021",
