  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide shows 65% similarity toAlamethicin. Warning: this is a peptaibol. Thus, alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib or methylalanine) is represented by A in the sequence. The N-terminal resididue is acetylated  and the C-terminus is a leucinol (i.e., CH2OH rather than COOH). Tricholongins  appeared as microheterogeneous mixtures of closely related peptides, as generally observed for peptaibols. Can lyse vesicles.",
