  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the unmodified sequence of this peptide shows 40% similarity toTemporin-CPa.Activity: Active against bacteria S. aureus(MIC 8-32 ug/ml), K. pneumoniae (MIC 16-32 ug/ml), A. baumannii and 14 clinical strains (MIC 4-16 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa (16-64 ug/ml), C. jejuni (4-64 ug/ml), E. coli K12 (MIC 32 ug/ml), S. typhimurium (MIC 32 ug/ml), E. faecalis (MIC 32 ug/ml) and L. monocytogenes (MIC 32 ug/ml). Also inhibited biofilm formation:bacteria and disrupted to some extent 48-h preformed biofilms.Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-insensitive:A. baumannii (150 mM), CaCl2-sensitive:A. baumannii (2.5 mM), MgCl2-insensitive:A. baumannii (1 mM), KCl-insensitive:A. baumannii (4.5 mM),  NH4Cl-insensitive:A. baumannii (6 uM), ZnCl2-insensitive:A. baumannii (8 uM), and FeCl3-insensitive:A. baumannii (4 uM).Structure:  random coil in water and helical in 30 mM SDS (Alexander et al., 2024).MOA:bacteria:A. baumannii DSM 30007:: at 4xMIC showed a strong membrane permeation.Resistance development:yes:bacteria:A. baumannii: A. baumannii DSM 30007 developed some resistance to this peptide in a 28 multiple passage experiment (MIC increased 8 fold).In vitro toxicity: it showed poor cytotoxicity to multiple cell lines (CC50 >184 ug/ml), including RBC (HC50 286 ug/ml).In vivo toxicity: didn't appear to be toxic to Galleria mellonella (90% survied at 8xMIC).Updated 10/2024",
