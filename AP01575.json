  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "AMP Significance: A recent study reveals the significance of TCP in host defense.  TCP binds to LPS or E. coli, leading to bacterial permeation and amyloidation/aggregation/agglutination (bacteria-agglutinating)?, which promotea clearance by phagocytic uptake (Petrlova et al., 2017).Discovery: Detected in human wounds in vivo.Activity: Radial diffusion assay: active against E. coli ATCC 25922 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27852.SAR:  synthetic shorter peptides from the very C-terminus of TCP are antibacterial and adopt helical conformation in lipid environments. The peptides inhibit macrophage responses to bacterial LPS by binding to LPS. Protect mice sepsis. These results establish a link between the coagulation system and host defense peptides.Toxicity: Unlike the fragment GKY-25, rTCP96 was not hemolytic at 10 uM.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: BL21 expression system has been established. Similar to the isolated form, the recombinant form rTCP96 can kill E. coli.Updated 5/2017; 2/2023.",
