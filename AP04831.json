    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is unique and shows only very low similarity (87.5%) toBrevinin-1SCActivity: S. aureus NCTC 6538 or MRSA 12,493 (MIC 2 uM), E. faecium NCTC 12,697 (MIC 4 uM), E. coli ATCC 8739 (MIC 4 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC 43,816 (MIC 8 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC CRM 9027 (MIC 8 uM), A. baumannii BAA 747 (MIC 8 uM), and C.albicans ATCC 10,231 (MIC >128 uM). MBC same or slightly higher.Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-sensitive: E. coli-dependent (150 mM), KCl-insensitive: E. coli (4.5 mM); CaCl2-sensitive: E. coli-dependent (2 mM); MgCl2-insensitive: E. coli-dependent (1 mM); ZnCl2-insensitive: E. coli (8 uM); NH4Cl-insensitive: E. coli (6 uM); FeCl3-insensitive: E. coli (4 uM).Structure: random coil in buffer NH4Ac and helical in 50% TFE or LPS.In vitro toxicity: horse RBC: HC50 37.64 uM, hemolytic. Less toxic to HaCaT skin cells (IC50 62.71 uM). Also showed effects on both H838 (IC50 6.88 uM) and MCF-7 (IC50 7.6 uM) cancer cell lines.",
