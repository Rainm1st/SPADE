Wt:   7121.332; molar extinction coefficient: 7165.Activity:  Diffusion zone assay: active against Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 29213, 25923 (19.0-19.7 mm), E. faecalis ATCC 29212 (15.2 mm), L. monocytogenes CMCC 54004 (16.7 mm),  Gram- E. coli ATCC 25922 (17.4 mm), Salmonella CMCC 50071 (20.6 mm), C. sakazakii ATCC 29544 (17.6 mm), also active against antibiotic-resistant C. sakazakii (18.5-21.2 mm) and Salmonella 557D (18.6 mm). The recombinant peptide (BMP32r) is active against Gram- E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 9.2 ug/ml), C. sakazakii ATCC 29544 (MIC 18.4 ug/ml), Salmonella SH11G0461 (MIC 27.6 ug/ml), C. sakazakii (MIC 18.4-27.6 ug/ml), Gram+ E. faecalis ATCC 29212 (MIC 18.4 ug/ml), S. aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC 18.4-36.8 ug/ml) inclusing antibiotic-resistant strains. It permeabilized the membranes of E. coli and S. aureus. Animal model:mouse: BMP32r reduced S. aureus load in the wound and promoted wound healing as well (Qiao Z. et al., 2020).
