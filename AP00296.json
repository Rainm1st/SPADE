    "Literature": "Chemical modification:  It contains four disulfide bonds:5,47; 16,36; 22,43; 26,45.Activity: Active against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and E. hirae.Warning: Note that the material used for antimicrobial activity assays contains both fabatin-1 and fabatin-2, which differ only at residue 13, N for fabatin-1 and H for fabatin-2. It's unclear whether these two very closely related fabatins differ in antimicrobial activity.Updated 12/2017; 7/2021.",
