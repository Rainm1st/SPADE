    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (90%) toM6K=R: 22%, others 10%.Peptide engineering:  the peptide is a branched form constructed on the platform of lysine to increase in vivo life time.  Warning: This dendrimer contains 4 chains of the same sequence shown.Activity: active against E. coli ATCC 25922 or W03BG0025 (MIC 0.7-1.5 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 or PAO1 or 10 more strains (MIC 0.3-1.5 uM, MIC90 1.4 uM from 70 strains),  K. pneumoniae 7086042 or  ATCC 13833 or 2 more strains (MIC 1.5-3.0 uM; MIC90 2.8 uM from 73 strains), A. baumannii RUH 134 or 875 or MR157 (MIC 1.5-3.0 uM), P-mirabilis W03VA1017S (MIC > 24 uM), E. aerogenes W03BG0067 (MIC 1.5 uM), E. cloacae W03AN0041 (MIC 1.5 uM), B-cepacia ORB-99 (MIC > 24 uM), S-marcescens W03BG0003 (MIC> 24 uM), S. aureus ATCC 29213 or 3851 (MIC 6 uM).Resistance development:no:bacteria:K. pneumoniae: K. pneumoniae showed 500 fold less likely to develop spontaneous resistance to the peptide than colistin.In vivo toxicity:mouse: acute toxicity: IV single dose: MTD 20 mg/kg (cf.: colistin toxic at 10 mg/kg.Animal model:mouse: neutropenic mice: sepsis:survival:I.P./I.V.:  it showed protective effect on P. eruginosa IP infected mice (1500 CFU/mouse) treated IV twice in 12 days with 60% survival (cf.: all died in 3 days without treatment). Lung infection:survival:i.n./i.v.: i.n. infected, IV treated twice 1 and 16 hpi, 40% survival after 10 days (Brunetti et al., 2016).",
