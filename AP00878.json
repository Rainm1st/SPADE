    "Literature": "Activity: Active against opportunistic yeast pathogens such as C. albicans ATCC 90029, V2414, V3577 (MIC 3-5 uM), C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019, 3804, V65A (MIC 5-10 uM), C. tropicalis V1757, V3117, B51a/5 (MIC 5 uM), C. krusei ATCC 6258, V5800, 4426 (MIC 5-10 uM), also Gram- E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 17-20 uM), K. pneumoniae KK3 9904 (MIC 40 uM), E. cloacae HNTCC 53001, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 10 uM), P.mirabilis (MIC >40 uM), Gram+ E. faecalis ATCC 29212 (MIC 5 uM), Streptococcus Group B HNTCC 80130 (MIC 10 uM), S. epidermidis RP62A (MIC 5 uM), and S. aureus NCTC 8352 (MIC 2 uM).  Also active against B. dendrobatidis (MIC 12.5 uM; Table 1, Rollins-Smith, BBA 2009; 1788:1593-1599).Toxicity: It is highly hemolytic (HC50 = 4-10 uM).Structure: NMR studies revealed a helix-hing-helix motif (Helix 1: Pro3 to Phe12; Helix 2:  Pro14 to Thr21) of the peptide in TFE, SDS or DPC micelles (Lewis DD et al., 2018).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure in 33% TFEherein the PDB; in SDSherein the PDB, and in DPCherein the PDB.Also provided by Erik Martin.
