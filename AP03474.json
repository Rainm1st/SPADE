    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (35.19%) toarchaeocin Halocin R1I: 12%; V:16%; A: 21%. GRAVY: 1.20; Mol Wt: 4379.157;  mol formula: C206H322N45O55S1; mol ex coeff: 10020, pI: 4.Strain activity screening: Two strains, P. freudenreichii LMGT 2946 and P. freudenreichii LMGT 2956, inhibited the growth of P. freudenreichii ISU-P59 (indicator strain) on agar plates.Updated 8/2024Biological processing: there have been no previous reports of probacteriocins that are processed at both the N and C termini.Peptide activity: Only strains of P. freudenreichii were sensitive to this bacteriocin (species-specific).
