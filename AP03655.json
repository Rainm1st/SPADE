  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (73.33%) toRRIKAR: 29%; I=L=A=W=K: 14%.  GRAVY: -0.73; M Wt: 1553.922; Mol formula: C73H122N26O12; molar extinction coeff: 11100.Activity: active against S. aureus MSSA or MRSA many strains (MIC 8-32 uM) and S. epidermidis (MIC 8 uM). Also antibiofilms.Antimicrobial robustness: MIC remained essentially the same in the presence of 100 mM NaCL: NaCl-insensitive:S. aureus. MgCl2-insensitive:S. aureus (2 mM physiological). In addition, there is no significant difference in killing up to 150 mM NaCl.Synergy:AMPs: it enhanced the killing of lysostaphin over 1000 fold.Toxicity: low level (~10%) hemolysis at 300 uM. low hemo.lytic. Not toxic to Hela cells at 4-8-fold antimicrobial concentrations.DNA binding: gel retardation. Provided by Arjun Nair.",
