In total, 70 clinical strains were tested and the results are expressed as a range. Also showed activity against biofilms:bacteria:P. aeruginosa (Artini et al., 2022). It appeared to have effects on protease levels of certain P. aeruginosa strains.Structure:  random coil in PBS buffer and helical in POPC (1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) LUVs ((Large Unilamellar Vesicles).In vitro toxicity: human RBC: ~25% hemolysis at 50 uM.",
