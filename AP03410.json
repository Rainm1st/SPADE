    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (90.32%) toAnisaxin-1Mol formula: C155H263N47O40 Mol Wt:3436.053; Mol Ex Coeff: 11100; GRAVY: -0.581.Activity:  Active against E. coli ATCC, c.i., or c.i.2 (MIC 0.5-2 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC, c.i., c.i.2 (MIC 0.5-2 uM), A. baumannii ATCC, c.i., or c.i.2. (MIC 0.5-2 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC, c.i., or c.i.2 (MIC 2-4 uM), and S. aureus ATCC (MIC 2 uM), S-aureus c.i., or c.i.2 (MIC >64 uM). All MBC values are similar to MIC values, indicative of a bactericidal effect.Toxicity:  the concentration that reduced 50% viability of HPBMC >100 uM.  NO vidence for DNA damage.Structure:  the peptide (20 uM) became helical in 50% TFE or 10 mM SDS based on CD studies.",
