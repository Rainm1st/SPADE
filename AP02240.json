    "Literature": "This peptide is an ortholog of lucifensin found in another species. Lucifensin II differs fromlucifensinat residue 11 (V in lucifensin and I in lucifensin II). It is therefore reasonable to predict that it has a similar3D structureto lucifensin. Lucifensin II is active against M. Luteus. Provided byCerovsky V.",
