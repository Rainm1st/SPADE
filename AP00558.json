    "Literature": "Constitutively expressed in the mantle. Active primarily against Gram+ M. lysodeikticus CIP 5345, B. megaterium CIP 6620, S. aureus CIP 103428, S. aureus SG511, S. simulans 22, S. hemolyticus, M. maritypicum CIP 105733T, B. stationis CIP 101282 (MIC 0.01-2 uM),and Gram- E. coli SBS 363 (MIC 20 uM).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. It has been proposed that this defensin binds to lipid II, thereby inhibiting cell wall synthesis of Gram-positive bacteria such as S. aureus (Schmitt P et al. 2010 J Biol Chem 285:29208-16).
