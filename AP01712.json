    "Literature": "Nomenclature: named after the discover/author.Sequence analysis: Sequence similarity: This sequence differs from subtilin at three residues: L6V, A15L, L24I.Chemical modification: Linearization of entianin using Raney nickel catalyzed reductive cleavage enabled for the first time the use of tandem mass spectrometry for the fast and efficient determination of an entire lantibiotic primary structure, also including post-translational modifications. There are  two di-dehydroalanines (Dha), S3, S31; one di-dehydrobutyrine (Dhb), T18; one lanthionine, S3-C7; and four methyllanthionines, T8-C11, T13-C19, T23-C26, and T25-C28.Activity:  unsuccinylated Entianin was active against several Gram-positive pathogens, such as S. aureus ATCC 29213 (MIC 4-8 ug/ml), S. aureus ATCC 43300 (MRSA) (MIC 8 ug/ml), E. faecalis ATCC 29212 (MIC 16 ug/ml), E. faecalis ATCC 51299 (VRE) (MIC 6-16 ug/ml, anti-VRE), and M. luteus ATCC 9341 (MIC 4-8 ug/ml).Natural variant: The growth-inhibiting activity of succinylated entianin (S-entianin) was strongly reduced as compared to entianin requiring a 40-fold higher concentration for inhibition.Updated 7/2021; 3/2022; 12/2022",
