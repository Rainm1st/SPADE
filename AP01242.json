    "Literature": "Activity: Moderately active (MIC 12-100 uM) against L. lactis and streptococcus uberis.SAR:  Interestingly, C-terminal amidation increased antibacterial activity by ~4-fold, indicating the important role of positive charge (Sherman PJ et al., 2009 Biochemistry 48: 11892-901. DOI: 10.1021).Structure:  The amidated peptide adopts a distorted helical structure in DPC micelles. Solid-state NMR analysis reveals the perturbation of membrane order and induces lipid domain formation in the presence of both PG and PC lipids.Updated 12/2009; 11/2024.",
