  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "The sequence contains 24 Gly, 12 Arg, and 17 Ser residues. Only the N-terminal 51 residues are Ser-rich. There are no Val, Leu, Phe, Cys, Met, Ala, Trp, Glu, Asp, His, Tyr, and Gln residues. Activity of the peptide is salt-sensitive. At low salt concentrations, MICs are about 10 uM for Gram- bacteria, 80 uM for Gram+, and 2.5 uM for fungi (Broekman DC et al. 2011 Peptides 32: 2044-2051). Updated 10/15/11.",
