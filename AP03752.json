GRAVY: -1.41; Mol Wt: 4207.161; Mol formula: C196H322N68O36; mol ex coeff: 0.Activity: active against parasite C. parvum in the form sporozoite but not oocyst. Active against E. coli ATCC 25922 or ML-35 (MIC 0.5 uM), S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028 (MIC 0.5 uM), S. marcescens ATCC8100 (MIC 1 uM), K. pneumoniae 13 clinical strains (MIC 0.25-1 uM), A. baumannii (12 clinical strains (MIC 0.5-16 uM), P. aeruginosa 20 clinical strains (MIC 0.5-32 uM), B-cepacia 10 clinical strains (MIC > 64 uM), S.aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC >128 uM), fungi C. neoformans (MIC 1-32 uM), P-etchellsii (MIC >32 uM), and C-albicans (MIC >64 uM) (Benincasa et al., 2004). It binds to LPS from Escherichia coli O111:B4.MOA:bacteria: SbmA is a bacterial inner membrane transporter required for importing the antimicrobial peptide (Runti et al., 2013). Bac7(1-35) binds to bacterial ribosomal proteins and inhibits protein synthesis (Mardirossian et al., 2014).Structure: the crystal structures of Bac7(1-35) bound to the Thermus thermophilus 70S ribosome has been determined (Gagnon et al., 2016).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. Only residues 1-19 have coordinates. By removing the first 4 critical residues, peptide Bac7(5-35) can only stabilize the initiation complex at a high concentration of 100 uM, providing a structural basis to the importance of the N-terminal segment (Seefeldt AC et al., 2016).Animal model:rats: Bac7(1-35) completely inhibits the LPS procoagulant activity at approximately 10 uM and significant decrease in plasma LPS, thereby protecting the animals from the lethal effect of endotoxin (Ghiselli et al., 2003).Updated 8/2024",
