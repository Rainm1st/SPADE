  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE most resembles (45%)Bombolitin II.Activity: Active against E. coli ATCC 11775 (MIC 4 ug/ml), S. aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC 16 ug/ml), and C. albicans ATCC 14053 (MIC 4 ug/ml). Note that the mature sequence may differ from the synthetic peptide used here.Immune modulation: Periplanetasin-5 suppressed the release of NO, TNF-alpha, IL-6 from  the Raw264.7 cells treated with LPS. This is achieved by inhibiting phosphorylation of MAPKs, an inflammatory signaling element, and reducing the degradation of IkB (Kim et al., 2020).
