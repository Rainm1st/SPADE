  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Nomenclature: originally named as BMAP-27-(1-18). A highly conserved single-residue variant (L17I) was made by Wang in 2008 for anti-HIV assays and named as BMAP-18. This name has been adopted in the literature since then to refer to this C-terminal fragment.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (66.67%) toBMAP-27K: 39%; F: 22%; R: 17%. GRAVY: -1.28; M Wt: 2342.927; Mol formula: C113H188N34O20; mol ex coeff: 0.Activity: Active against E. coli ATCC 25922 ML-35 or D21 (MIC 2-4 uM), S. typhimurium ATCC 14028 (MIC 4 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 1-4 uM), S. marcescens ATCC 8100 (MIC 2 uM), S. aureus ATCC 25923  Cowan 1 or MRSA (MIC 2-4 uM), S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC 1-4 uM), B. megaterium Bm11 (MIC 2 uM), C. albicans (MIC 16 uM), and C. neoformans (MIC 4 uM). Recent MIC values have been merged with the previous data. Also inhibited biofilm formation at 16 uM and disrupted preformed biofilms at 8 uM.Also, active against parasite BSF and PCF of T. b. brucei (IC50 8-12 ug/ml),  T. b. rhodesiense ViTat 1.1 PCF (IC50 ~30 ug/ml), T. b. gambiense U2 PCF (IC50 ~10 ug/ml), T. congolense IL3000 PCF (IC50 ~25 ug/ml), T. danilewskyi TrCa (IC50 ~32 ug/ml), and L. donovani LD3 (IC50 ~31 ug/ml) (Haines et al., 2009). Anti-inflammatory activity (supression of IL-6) is much weaker than LL-37 and its Leucine analog (AP3759).Toxicity: sheep RBC: not hemo.lytic until 20 uM. 20% hemolysis at 30-130 uM. HC50 at 16-32 uM to RAW264.7 mouse macrophages.Structure: it became helical in 0.1% LPS.MOA:bacteria: it targets membranes, especially Gram+ bacteria.SAR: BMAP-18 ( i.e. N-terminal 18-residues of BMAP-27) is HIV-active. Further deletion of three C-terminal residues from BMAP-18 led to a peptide (BMAP-15) that is inactive to HIV-1 (see ref).Surface immobilization: BMAP-18 has been covalently linked to agarose beads or titanium surface with activity against S. epidermidis (Boix-Lemonche et al., 2019). Bomidin is a derivative of BMAP-18 with one additonal Met at the N-terminus. Bomidin inhibted V. parahaemolyticus, an important aquatic pathogen (PMID: 34642879).",
