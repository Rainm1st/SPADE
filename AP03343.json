    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (54.35%) tofungal AnAFPGRAVY: -0.383; Mol form: C427H684N124O139S8; Mol Wt: 10087.399; molar extinction coefficient: 4845. The first 18 residues are a signal region for extracellular secretion.Activity: Active against S. aureus and C. albicans (agar diffusion assay). MIC assays: S. aureus (MIC 32 ug/ml; 3.9 uM) and MRSA (128 ug/ml; 15.4 uM). Inhibited biofilm formation of S. aureus and MRSA at 2 and 8 ug/ml, respectively.Toxicity:  13% hemolysis at 128 ug/ml, poorly hemo.lytic to human RBC.
