  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (47.06%) toGMA4CGR: 36%, C: 18%.Activity: active against E. coli ATCC 8739 (MIC 4 ug/ml) and S. aureus (MIC 4 ug/ml).In vitro toxicity: low hemolysis at 128 ug/ml but showed moderate toxicity to at 32 and 64 ug/ml. It killed 50% RAW 264.7 cells at 128 ug/ml.Animal model:mouse: BALB/c mice: acute carrageenan-induced peritonitis, RC11 treatment (7.5 mg/kg) one hour later reduced TNF-alpha by 45% (Cf: dexamethasone decreased by 32%) and IL-12 by 28%.",
