  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: In medium A supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2 and 50 mM KCl, the peptide is active against fungi B. cinerea (IC50 6 ug/ml), C. sphaerospermum (IC50 1 ug/ml), F. culmorum (IC50 1 ug/ml), L. maculans (IC50 25 ug/ml), P. digitatum (IC50 1 ug/ml), T. viride (IC50 15 ug/ml), S. tritici (IC50 0.5 ug/ml), and V. albo-atrum (IC50 12 ug/ml) (FEBS Lett. 1995 Jul 17;368(2):257-62).  Both non-germinated and germinated conidia of F. moniliforme were susceptible to these peptides. Overall, F. moniliforme was more susceptible than A. flavus to the peptide.MOA:fungi: The peptide bound strongly to chitin, mannan, galactocerebrosides, and sphingomyelin (Mycopathologia. 1998-1999;144:87-91). [35S]Hs-AFP1 also bound specifically and reversibly to microsomal membranes derived from N. crassa hyphae with a Kd of 27 nM and a Bmax of 102 pmol/mg protein. The similarity in Kd value between binding sites on hyphae and microsomes indicates that Hs-AFP1 binding sites reside on the plasma membrane. Rs-AFP2 itself was able to compete with [35S]Hs-AFP1.
