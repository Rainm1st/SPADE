  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Althouh variable results have been observed for the antimicrobial activity of this neuropeptide, several recent articles support the claim. Active against S. aureus and C. albicans. Remarkably, it shows in vitro antifungal activity at 1fM to 1 pM, much less than nM for some lantibiotics and uM for many AMPs. NMR studies found a hairpin loop structure in water (Lee et al. 1998 Eur J Biochem 257:31-40). There are many analogs for this peptides and structures were determined for some of them.
