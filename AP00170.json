    "Literature": "Activity: Active against M. luteus (MIC 5-10 uM), B. megaterium (MIC 1-2.5 uM), S-aureus (MIC>10 uM), E. coli D22 or 1106 (MIC 1-10 uM) or lower, E cloacae beta12 (MIC 5-10 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 82118 (MIC 5-10 uM), other bacteria > 10 uM.Chemical modification: The Thr is O-glycosylated.Structure: Rich in Proline. See also AP172. Native pyrrhocoricin is largely disordered in solution with a subpopulation of ordered turns over residues 2-5, 4-7, and 16-19 based on NMR studies. The N-terminal region, residues 2-10, is important for activity, while the C-terminal half of the peptide is important for cell entrance. For the structure of the active region residues 1-10 in complex with the E. coli heat shock protein DnaK, see the PDB link.You can rotate, zoom, and view the complex structure with T. thermophilus 70S ribosomeherein the PDB.MOA:The peptide appears to target DnaK within bacteria via the N-terminal active region. All-D form is inactive, so not targeting bacterial membranes for killing. However, this peptide may acutally inhibit translationa process in the cell-free E. coli protein synthesis system (Taniguchi M et al., 2016).  The macrocyclic derivative incorporates a nine amino acid linker joining the N- and C-termini, which does not adversely affect the antimicrobial potency but leads to a broader spectrum of activity (Eur J Biochem 2002; 269: 4226-4237). It may be a useful delivery module to get cargos into cells.   Updated 9/2013; 2/2014; 11/2015; Jan2016; 4/2016; 6/2017; 7/2021",
