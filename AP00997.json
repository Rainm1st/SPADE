    "Literature": "Two-dimensional NMR analysis (Biosci. Biotechnolo. Biochem. 72:1750-1755, 2008) revealed multiple post-translational modifications: T2 to Dhb2 (dehydrated); S5, Dha (dehydrated); T8, T23, T25, all to Abu; S33, to Dha. In addition, residues 3,7; 8,11; 13,19; 23,26; 25,28 are covalently linked via a sulfur (thioether). Similar covalent links occur in nisin A (AP00205) and nisin Z (AP00204).",
