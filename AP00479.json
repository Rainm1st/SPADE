    "Literature": "Activity: Strong activity against several soil-borne pathogenic fungi such as A. panax, Fusarium sp., and R. solani. Active against B. megaterium (IC50 8 ug/ml), Staphyanococcus sp. (IC50 11 ug/ml), and E.coli (IC50 >300 ug/ml).Peptide stability: heat-stable.Structure: It contains three disulfide bonds: 3,20; 10,24; 19,35. The global fold involves a cystine-knotted three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet (residues 8-10, 23-27, 32-36), a flexible loop (residues 14-19), and four beta-reverse turns (residues 4-8, 11-14, 19-22, 28-32). This structure features all the characteristics of the knottin fold. It is the first structural model of an antifungal peptide that adopts a knottin-type structure (Gao et al., 2001).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. A hydrophobic surface, comprising Y23, F25, I27, Y32, and V34, is bordered by basic R9, K36, and R38. Such a structural feature may be important for antimicrobial activity.ReDiscovery: also reported by (Liu et al., 2000) in the same plant seeds.
