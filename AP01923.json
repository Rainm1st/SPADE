    "Literature": "Activity: Highly active against B. subtilis, S. aureus, E. coli (MIC 0.8-7.7 uM) and moderately active against P. aeruginosa (MIC ~45 uM). Also active against C. albicans (MIC 6-7 uM) as well as cancer cells  such as Hela S3, CRC SW480, and CCRF-CEMT IC50 12-35 uM (Slaninova J et al. 2012 Peptides 33:18-26).Amyloid AMPs: LPS induced amyloid formation of Hal-2 (Wang et al., 2014).Structure: Secondary structures were determined by both CD and NMR.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: pET22b vector, sumo fusion protein, Ni2+ -NTA affinity chromatography, clleaved with sumo, HPLC purification.SAR: Numerous variants were generated to understand the sequence-activity relationships.
