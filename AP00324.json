    "Literature": "Activity: Active against B. cereus (MIC 25 ug/ml), L. lactis (MIC 3 ug/ml), L. innocua (MIC 25 ug/ml), M. luteus (MIC 12.5 ug/ml), S. aureus (MIC 50 ug/ml), S. epidermidis (MIC 12.5 ug/ml), S. uberis (MIC 12.5 ug/ml), E. coli (MIC>100 ug/ml),  and P. multocida (MIC >100 ug/ml) (reviewed by Apponyi et al., 2004). Also active against M. luteus (MIC 2-4 uM), less active against S. hominis, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus (disc diffusion assay).MOA:bacteria: It also forms amyloid fibrils rapidly in solution at neutral pH. This may be related to antibacterial activity (Calabrese AN et al., 2015).Structure: It is helical in the presence of lipids (CD). However, the free peptide in the crystal can be in the fibril form, indicating structural plasticity (Amyloid AMPs).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Updated 3/2015; 12/2015; 7/2020; 7/2021.",
