    "Literature": "Activity: Active against E. coli (MIC 6 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 3 uM), E. cloacae (MIC 6 uM),  K. pneumoniae (MIC 6 uM), S. aureus (MIC 25 uM), and C.albicans (MIC>100 uM). HC50 55 uM. The most abundant peptide, brevinin-2PRa (680 nmol/g weight of dry skin) showed high potency [minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values between 6 and 12 microM] against a range of clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa.Antimicrobial robustness: Salt-insensitive: activity against P. aeruginosa in MHB medium was unaffected by NaCl concentrations up to 200 mM.
