    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (90%) todesign template D2-NH2K=R: 30%; W: 20%, G=S: 10%.  GRAVY: -1.99; M Wt: 1344.617; Mol formula: C63H103N21O12; molar extinction coeff: 11100.Activity: active against E. coli (MIC 6 uM), S. aureus (MIC 6 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 25 uM)Antimicrobial robustness: MIC increased 4-fold or more in the presence of 150 mM NaCL: NaCl-sensitive:E. coli; NaCl-sensitive:S. aureus; NaCl-sensitive:P. aeruginosa.Toxicity: it caused 5% hemolysis at 100 uM (low hemo.lytic).SAR: The amidated peptide was more active than the non-amidated counterpart.
