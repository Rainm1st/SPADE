  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (51.52%) toRetrocd2P=K=R: 13%. Name: 31-6 means a peptide length of 31 residues with a net charge of +6.Activity: Active against E. coli (MIC 0.313 uM), B. megaterium (MIC 0.02 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 10 uM), and S. aureus (MIC 10 uM) at pH 7.5.Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-insensitive:B. megaterium (150 mM), NaCl-insensitive:E. coli (150 mM), NaCl-insensitive:P. aeruginosa (150 mM).  pH-insensitive:B. megaterium (pH 7.5 to 5.5), pH-sensitive:E. coli (pH 7.5 to 5.5), pH-insensitive:P. aeruginosa (pH 7.5 to 5.5).Peptide stability:  the Trp-cage fusion increased stability to trypsin but not chymotrypsin.Structure:  NMR studies revealed a stable helical structure for residues K8-A19, dynamic helix Q5-I7, and random coils for K1-V4. The helical structure results from the stabilization of Trp cage, which confers stability to the peptide by extending the helical structure initiated by Trp cage.",
