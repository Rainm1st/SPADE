    "Literature": "Activity: Only showed weak antibacterial activity. Active against fungi: P. capsici (87.22% inhibition), V. dahliae (40.55% inhibition), F. graminearum (21.35% inhibition), and F. omysporum (15.98% inhibition). Interstingly, the same peptide has also been identified in Lactobacillus crustorum MN047 (Yi et al., 2018). Inhibition zone assays reveal broad-spectrum activity. active against Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 29213, 25923 (15.3-17.4 mm), E. faecalis ATCC 29212 (10.2 mm), L. monocytogenes CMCC 54004 (12.1 mm),  Gram- E. coli ATCC 25922 (12.3 mm), Salmonella CMCC 50071 (12.1 mm), C. sakazakii ATCC 29544 (15 mm), also active against antibiotic0resistant C. sakazakii (14.6-18.1 mm) and Salmonella 557D (12 mm). Found in multiple species. UPdated 7/2021",
