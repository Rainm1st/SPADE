    "Literature": "Activity: Active against E. coli (MIC 34.5 ug/ml), S. dysgalactiae (MIC 21.8 ug/ml), S. agalactiae (30.5 ug/ml), S. aureus PTCC 1431 (42.1 ug/ml), S. typhimurium PTCC 1428 (MIC 31.8 ug/ml), and K. pneumoniae (MIC 35.1 ug/ml).Chemical modification: Synthetic C-terminally amidated peptide is active against S. aureus (MIC 19.8 ug/ml), but poorly active against E.coli (MIC 248 ug/ml) and A.baumannii (MIC 248 ug/ml).Toxicity: The peptide showed a dose-deppendnet effect on bllod cells and about 1.1% hemolysis at 60 ug/ml.Chemical modification: Although not reported, the peptide is likely amidated at the C-terminus.Structure: Synthetic C-terminally amidated peptide is helical in the presence of 50% or 100% TFE or POPG (Lopes et al., 2022).
