    "Literature": "Active against a variety of fungi (A. alternata, A. solani, F. solani, F. verticillioides, P. betae, P. infestans, P. debaryanum, P. ultimum). The peptide is also active against P. infestans, a protist. EcAMP1 is also active against plant fungal pathogens, including F. graminearum (IC50 4.5 uM), F. oxysporum (IC50 8.5 uM), and B. sorokiniana (IC50 18.2 uM). There are two disulfide bonds (C7-C29 and C11-C25) that tie the two helices together into a unique beta hairpin structure. Other more sophisticated disulfide bond stabilized helical structures include distinctin and several saposin-like AMPs such as porcine NK-lysin and caenopore-5. MOA: EcAMP1 binds to fungal surface followed by internalization without disrupting membranes.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. Updated 9/19/11. GW.",
