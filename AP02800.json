    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE shows 38% similarity toSibaDef.Activity: Active against S. aureus, but not commensal bacteria.Chemical modification:   Four thioether bonds are proposed: S9-C12, S20-C24, T26-C29 and S30-C33. In addition, there are five dehydrated S/T at the N-terminus of the peptide.Updated 4/2024",
