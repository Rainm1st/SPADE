    "Literature": "Chemical modification: It contains 4 disulfide bonds (C4-C25, C10-C33, C14-C35, and C21-C38) among which the fourth S-S bond is not important for antibacterial activity. Trp28 is hydroxylated. This hydroxylation appears no to influence antimicrobial activity.Activity: active against M. luteus (MIC 0.08 ug/ml), E. coli (MIC 6.4 ug/ml), V. alginolyticus (MIC 6.4 ug/ml), V. splendidus (MIC 1.6 ug/ml), and vibrio P1 (MIC 6.4 ug/ml).Structure: Its 3D structure has the typical systine-stabilized alpha-beta fold (Helix: 7-16; beta 1: 20-25; beta 2: 33-37) (Yang YS et al. Biochemistry 2000 Nov 28;39:14436-47).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Transgenic plants: expression of this peptide in tobacco improves resistance to pathogens (Montesinos E 2007 FEMS Microbiol Lett 270, 1-11).Updated 2/2014; 11/2024.",
