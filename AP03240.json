  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (90.4%) toHainanenin 5.Mol formula: C109H185N27O24S2; Mol Wt: 2321.96; GRAVY: 1.08. Isolated from the same frog species, it differs from Hainanenin 5 only at positions 9 (R vs. V) and 12 (S vs. K).Activity: Active against Gram+ S. aureus (MIC 4 uM), MRSA (MIC 8 uM), S. aureus biofilms, Gram- E. coli (MIC 16 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 64 uM), K. pneumoniae (MIC 64 uM), and yeast C. albicans (MIC 16 uM). MBC values are rather similar to MIC (equal or 2 fold hihger). This parent peptide can also inhibit the proliferation of multiple cancer cell lines H157, PC-3, MB435S and HCT116 human cancer cell lines (IC50 3.4-5.9 uM).Toxicity: The WT peptide is moderate hemolytic (20% at 16 uM and HC50 = ~50 uM).Structure: predicted to be helical.SAR: To reduce toxicity, two derivatives were made: Brevinin-1Ha (FALGAVTCLIRTKCKVLPKLF), where the Rana box has migrated to the central region, and Brevinin-1HY (FALGAVTKVLYKLFCLITRKC), where the substituion P11Y was made. Brevinin-1Ha has lost antimicrobial activity, indicating the importance of C-terminal location of the Rana box. Interestingly, brevinin-1HY lost activity against Gram- E. coli, P. aeruginosa,. and K. pneumoniae, indicating resudue P plays a role in determinting peptide activity spectrum. Brevinin-1Ha is poorly hemolytic, while Brevinin-1HY is more hemolytic (HC50= ~6 uM). Updated 7/2021",
