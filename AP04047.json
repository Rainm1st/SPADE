    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (87.5%) toPlectasinG: 20%; C: 15%. GRAVY: -0.645; mol Wt: 4460.125; mol formula: C192H287N58O53S6; mol ex coeff: 10395.Activity: active against  S. aureus ATCC 25923 or ATCC 43300 or E48 or CVCC 546 or CAAS-FRI-2023-01 or CAAS-FRI-2023-02 and 8 clinical strains (MIC 2-64 ug/ml), S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 or ATCC 35984 (MIC 4-8 ug/ml), S. dysgalactiae CVCC 3938 (MIC 4 ug/ml), S. agalactiae ATCC 13813 or CAU-FRI-2022-01 or CAU-FRI-2022-02 (MIC 4 ug/ml). MBC are 2-8 fold higher. rapid killing, including intracellular S. aureus.SAR: Compared to the WT, five aa changes were made: D9S, M13L, Q14R, N17R, and K26R, leading to an increase in net charge and (activity?).Synergy:antibiotics: showed synergistic effect on S. aureus with arg26-ceftiofur (FICI: 0.3125).Peptide stability: activity retained till 80oC.Antimicrobial robustness: retained pH 2-10 (pH-insensitive), 25-50% serum (up to 8 h) (serum-insensitive); gastric juice (2 h), but lost in Intestinal juice (0.25 h); NaCl-insensitive:S. aureus (50-300 mM), KCl-insensitive:S. aureus (1.25-5 mM), CaCl2-insensitive:S. aureus (1.25-5 mM), and MgCl2-insensitive:S. aureus (1.25-5 mM).Resistance development:yes:bacteria:S. aureus: S. aureus MRSA developed resistance to this peptide slightly after 30 passages. MIC increased 8 fold.MOA:bacteria: damage cell membrane and upset metabolism.Structure:  beta structure in water, SDS, and TFE due to disulfide bonds.In vitro toxicity: murine RBC: <4% hemolysis at 256 ug/ml (not hemo.lytic). slight cytotoxicity to mouse RAW264.7 cells at 256 ug/ml (~75% survival).In vivo toxicity: Acute toxicity in mice: Little changes in blood cell profiles (7 days IP injection; 10 mg/kg).Recombinant production:yeast:Pichia pastoris: more expressed in 5L fermentor (3.1 mg/ml in supernatant at 120 h) than in shaking flask; this high expression may pave the way for its applications.It is a potential lead.",
