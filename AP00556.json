  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Structure:  It adopts an amphipathic alpha-helical conformation in a membrane-mimetic solvent, 50% TFE.SAR: Mutational studies indicate that C-terminal deamidation reduced the antimicrobial activity by 4-fold against E. coli and 16-fold against S. aureus. Incorporation of a lysine to replace G7, S18, or D19 increased antimicrobial activities as well as hemolytic activity. If D-lysines were used in those positions, antibacterial activity against gram-negative bacteria remained similar but the activities against gram-positive bacteria or fungi were reduced (Conlon et al. 2005 Peptides 26: 2104-2110). Note that a similar peptide Kassinatuerin-2 with a sequence FIQYLAPLIPHAVKAISDLI was found to be inactive against the same group of microbes.",
