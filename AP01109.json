  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "MIC not found.Variant 1: linear one: The sequence is identical. The head-to-tail peptide bond is absent, thereby it is an acyclotide (the original entry 1133 has been merged with this entry).Variant 2: A Trp oxidized derivative was also found (the original entry 1134 for the oxidized form has been merged with this entry).",
