    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of Urumin is unique and ONLY shows 36.7% similarity tobacterial Siamycin II, known also to be antiviral.   C2: molecular formula:  C129H201N40O35S2; Mol Wt 2961.39; GRAVY= -0.033; Wimley-White whole-residue hydrophobicity of the peptide: 0.59  kcal/mol.Activity:It is uncommon that an amphibian peptide is specifically active against human H1 Hemagglutinin-Bearing Influenza A Viruses (IAV H1N1). The IC50 of urumin was 3.8 uM. No activity against other viruses tested.In vitro toxicity: For\nurumin, the toxic dose (TD50) was 2,450 uM (Figure 1C), leading to a TI = TD50/IC50  644.7, indicative of a favorable therapeutic profile.SAR:The peptide synthesized in D-amino acids is inactive (L>D), in agreement with a non-membrane H1 Hemagglutinin targetComment on this work.AMP News.Updated 12/2017;   5/2019; 12/2024",
