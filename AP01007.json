    "Literature": "Activity: lethal concentration (LC): active against E. coli D21 (LC 1 uM), P. aeruginosa OT97 (LC 4 uM), B. subtilis (LC 0.5 uM), B. megaterium (LC 0.7 uM), S. aureus Cowan 1 (LC 2 uM), and S. pyogenes (LC 0.5 uM).Antimalarial activity:P. falciparum (IC50 7.5 uM).  New MIC data: active against Gram+ E. faecalis PCM 2673 (MIC 8 ug/ml), S. aureus ATCC 25923 or 9144 (MIC 4 ug/ml), S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 (MIC 0.5 ug/ml), Gram- E. coli ATCC 25922 or 23506 (MIC 1-2 ug/ml), K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 (MIC 0.125 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027 (MIC 2 ug/ml), fungi  A. niger ATCC 16404 (MIC 16 ug/ml), C. albicans ATCC 10231 (MIC 32 ug/ml), and C. glabrata ATCC 15126 (MIC 64 ug/ml) (Neubauer et al., 2017).MOA:bacteria: The peptide forms pore on membranes.Structure:  helical in 20% hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure bound to DPC micellesherein the PDB.In vitro toxicity: sheep RBC (LC >300 uM), not hemo.lytic.Surface immobilized peptide: It has been surface immobilized 2016 onto gold nanoparticles at a high density of 110 ug/cm2 with a braod activity spectrum (Rai A et al., 2016).Chemical modification: Succinylation of the amino acids at the N-terminus and lysine side chains inhibits the effect of this peptide on liposome permeability. This modification appears to block the formation of helical structure in liposome.Updated Jan2025AMP inactivation:  Warning: CM15 lost its activity when Polysulfonated Drug Suramin is also used or present. They can form complex via electrostatic interactions (Quemé-Peña et al., 2019).Updated Jan 2011; 2/2014; 6/2016; 6/2019; 8/2024; 11/2024.",
