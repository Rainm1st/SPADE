    "Literature": "This is a two-component lantibiotic. The sequence of Carnolysin A1 is provided in the sequence field.  The sequence of Carnolysin A2 is GDVMPESTPICAGFATLMSSIGLVKTIKGKC. Both sequences are processed after post-translation.  Altogether, there are six dehydrated ser or thr, and five thioether bonds in the two chains. For Carnolysin A1, residues 8, 10, and 25 are dehydrated; thioether bonds exist between residues 9, 13; 24,28; 41,45; residues 16, 21, 33, 36, are D-amino acids. For Carnolysin A2, residues 8, 16, and 20 are dehydrated; thioether bonds exist between 7, 11; 26, 31; residues 16 and 19 are D-amino acids, which is the first D-Abu in ribosomally synthesized peptide (Lohans CT et al. 2014). However, further processing appeared to be required to generate active peptides, for example, digestion with endoproteinase GluC.Activity: The digested peptides were active against L. lactis,\nE. faecium, and C. maltaromaticum.
