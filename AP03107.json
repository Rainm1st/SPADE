    "Literature": "Host expression: highly expressed in gill and was up-regulated with bacterial challenges.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (24.3%) toCtenidin-2.Activity: Active against Gram+ S. aureus (MIC 0.7-1.4 uM), B. subtilis (MIC 0.7-1.4 uM), B. megaterium (MIC 0.35-0.7 uM), Gram-  V. alginolyticus (MIC 1.4-2.8 uM), V. parahaemolyticus (MIC 0.7-1.4 uM), V. harveyi (MIC MIC 0.7-1.4 uM), E. coli (MIC 2.8-5.6 uM), and fungi C. albicans (MIC 2.8-5.6 uM).   In addition, SpCrus2 agglutinates gram-positive bacteria (bacteria-agglutinating).SAR: 1-64 is a GRR (gly-rich region) and 65-147 is a CRR (Cys-rich region). Both regions are antimicrobial but slightly less active than the full length.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: all the peptides were expressed and purified.7/2021; 11/2024",
