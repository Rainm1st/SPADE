  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: identified based on typical features of AMPs.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is 44.44% similar toEumenine mastoparan-AF. K: 29%, L=S: 12%.Activity: Active against Gram- E. coli O157:H7 or K12 (MIC 5.8-25 uM), P. aeruginosa Pak (MIC 7 uM), A.naeslundii (MIC >100 uM), P.gingivalis HG 66 (MIC>100 uM),  Gram+ B. subtilis ATCC 9372 (MIC 18 uM), S.sanguis SK4 (MIC >100 uM), S.mutans (MIC >100 uM), and yeast C. albicans ATCC 10231 (MIC 2.1 uM).MOA:fungi:C. albicans: acted on membranes.In vitro toxicity: human RBC: only hemolytic at high concentration close to 100 uM.Structure: 3D structures of the peptide in complex with SDS or DPC have been determined by 2D NMR. Helical for the N-terminal 11 residues but disordered for the C-terminal region. The C-terminal charged region is proposed to initiate binding followed by helix formation at the N-terminus (Haney et al., 2007).",
