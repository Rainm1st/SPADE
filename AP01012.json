  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Active against Gram- E. coli DH5alpha, E. coli DH1 (MIC 2.5-6 uM), P-aeruginosa (MIC>40 uM), Gram+ A. globiformis, B. subtilis (MIC 0.3-1.2 uM), yeasts P. pastoris, S. cerevisiae (MIC 20 uM).  The same peptide called La47  is also found by Garcia F et al. (2013) J Antibiotic 66: 3-10. These authors found that the peptide is poorly active against E. coli (MIC 100 ug/ml) or S. aureus (MIC 84 ug/ml). Also Active against Gram- A. baumannii ATCC 003321216 (MIC 4 ug/ml), E.coli ATCC 25922 (MIC >128 ug/ml), K.pneumoniae ATCC 13883 (MIC >128 ug/ml), P.aeruginosa KPC+ 003321199 (MIC >128 ug/ml), Gram+ P.acnes ATCC 51277 (MIC >128 ug/ml) and S.aureus ATCC 7133623 (MIC > 128 ug/ml).  It also inhibits biofilm formation against A. baumannii ATCC 003321216 (MBIC 32 ug/ml) and E. coli ATCC 25922 (MBIC 16 ug/ml). It also inhibited C1498, Kasumi-1 and K562 cancer cell lines (Filipe Nunes et al., 2022).Virus: inhibited Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 HIV-1 (EC50 32.7 uM).Toxicity: TC50 >40.3 uM in CEM-SS cells.Structure: helical in 60% TFE.Toxicity:  Rabbit erythrocytes (20% lysis): >120 uM, HC50>100 uM, poor hemolytic.SAR: synthetic derivatives for Ltc3a are available (see AP3509, AP3510, and AP3511).
