    "Literature": "Chemical modification:  post-translational modifications of GSC, GCS, and GCS triplets led to fused heterocycles in three locations.MOA:bacteria:E. coli: These fused heterocycles could contribute to the binding to DNA gyrase-DNA complex, the likely target of MccB. Without fused heterocycle at site B, the peptide is inactive.Activity: Active against E. coli BL21 DE3 (MIC 0.06 uM).SAR: removal of unmodified C-terminal amino acids of McB, which has no effect on fused \n33 heterocycles, substantially reduced activity in vivo and in vitro. Further, even non-conservative point substitutions in the last McB amino acid influenced peptide activity by simultaneously decreasing uptake and ability to inhibit the gyrase.Updated 10/2024",
