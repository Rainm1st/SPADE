  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 35.7% similarity toThuricin CD. GRAVY  0.61; Mol Wt 3819.52; Mol formula C165H257N43O49S6.Activity: aM1 showed a cytotoxic effect against insect Sf9 cells. The 0.1% DMSO, a negative control, did not show significant cytotoxic effect, while 10% Triton-X 100, a positive control, destroyed over 99% cell death after 24 h treatment.Toxicity: Note that aM1 is nontoxic to CHO-K1 cells at concentrations up to 200 uM, implying an insect-cell-specific effect.",
