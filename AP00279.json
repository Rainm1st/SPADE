    "Literature": "Activity: Active against E. coli  ML-35p,  L. monocytogenes  EGD  and  C. albicans  in  radial  diffusion  assays (dose dependent, see Fig. 6 in the ref). More active than Clavanin A or B (see ref). Recent tests reveled activity against E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 64 ug/ml), E.faecalis ATCC 29212 (MIC 128 ug/ml), S.aureus ATCC 43300 (MIC 128 ug/ml), and C. albicans ATCC 10231 (MIC 16 ug/ml). Antimicrobial activity was not enhanced by metals such as Zn2+ or Cu2+. In the case of E. coli and C. albicans MIC values increased in the presence of metals (Zn2+ or Cu2+) (Miller et al., 2021) (Provided by Adriana Miller). Updated 7/2021; 2/2023",
