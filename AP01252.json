    "Literature": "Active against Gram+ B. megaterium Bm11 (MIC 20 uM), S. lentus (MIC 50 uM), M. luteus (MIC 10 uM), fungi  C. tropicalis (MIC 11 uM), C. guiller-mondii (MIC 6.6 uM), P. nicotianae spores (MIC 75 uM). 85% hemolysis at 100 uM.  The peptide name reflects the N- and C-terminal residues. One S-S bond between Cys5 and Cys15. The peptide has potent immunomodulatory effects on mast cells and granulopoietic progenitor cells. It is one of the most potent nonlytic histamine-releasing peptide. Antimicrobial activities of the peptide were reported in Biochemistry 2003; 42: 14023-35). Updated 7/2021",
