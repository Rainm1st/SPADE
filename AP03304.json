    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (34.78%) toPhylloxin-B1GRAVY: 0.34; Mol formula: C95H156N26O27S4; M. Wt: 2222.706, and Mol ex coeff.: 0. This peptide was selected based on activity by comparing with other peptides.Structure:  helical in membrane-mimetic 50% HFIP (Hexafluoro-2-propanol).Activity: (APD converted ug/ml to uM): moderately active against Gram+ S. aureus (MBC 45 uM), B. subtilis (MBC 41 uM), E. faecium (MBC 38 uM), S. sindenensis (MBC 43 uM), E. faecalis (MBC 38 uM), S. pneumoniae (MBC 45 uM), Gram- E. coli (MBC 38 uM), P. aeruginosa,  K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii (MBC 45 uM),  E. aerogenes (MBC 41 uM), MDR pathogens MRSA (MBC 45 uM), Vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (MBC 54 uM), Vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VRE, MBC 45 uM), Carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, Carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (MBC 50 uM), and Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (MBC 45 uM).Toxicity: A single intravenous injection of AMPR-11 (100 mg/kg) into mice did not show severe clinical signs of toxiciuch as deaths or weight loss for 15 days.MOA:  act on membranes.Animal model:mouse: normal: It increased mouse survival rate by 60% after a single dose intravenous treatment one hour post infection with S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, or A. baumannii. This efficacy is comparable to that achieved by imipenem intraperitoneally injected four times (every 12 h) 24 h post infection. It is proposed that the observed efficacy results from rapid killing, robust antibacterial activity (not binding to serum or lipoproteins), and LPS neutralization.  Reg. 12/2021",
