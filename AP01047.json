  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Its expression shows seasonal variation. Kalata B5 can only be isolated when the plant is flowering. This peptide displayed moderate hemolytic activity. It has a typical cyclic cystine knot structure. The hydrophobic patch could be important for membrane binding as well as hemolytic activity (Plan et al. 2010 Biopolymers May 26 in press).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.
