  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (86.67%) toBmKn2-7R or Kn2-5R-NH2R: 33%, F: 27%, I: 20%.Activity: active against multiple clinical Salmonella strains (MIC 4-8 uM). MBC values are identical, indicating bactericidal. Showed an effect on biofilms:bacteria as well. Warning: Other bacteria not tested.In vitro toxicity: human RBC: HC50 5.6 uM, highly hemolytic.SAR: The addition of a pair of hydrophobic FF to the N-terminus made the optimized peptide highly hemolytic.",
