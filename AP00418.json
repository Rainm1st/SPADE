  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: This appears to be the first peptide in the cathelicidin family demonstrated to have antibacterial activity against various Gram-positive S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and S. aureus or MRSA and Gram-negative bacteria E. coli HB101, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and P. apacia. C-albicans (inactive at 20 ug/ml).Antimicrobial robustness: Activity remains in serum (serum-less susceptible).Structure: The peptide is helical in either lipid A or 30% TFE based on CD. 3D structure of a 32-residue N-terminal fragment (PDB entry 1LYP) was determined in 30% TFE by solution NMR as a complete and rigid helix (Chen C et al. 1995 FEBS Lett 370: 46-52).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure in 30% TFEherein the PDB. Since the full sequence of this peptide shows 42.1% sequence homolog with human LL-37 (AP310), the APD predicts that CAP18(106-142) shares a similar structure with the undetermined C-terminal sequence disordered and not required for bacterial killing.Derivatives:  A 13-residue fragment with a sequence KIKEKLKKIGQKI was found to be active against P. aeruginosa PAO1 at a MIC 14.8 uM (cf. full length CAP18, MIC was 0.22 uM) (Travis SM et al. 2000 Infect Immunity 68: 2748-55).
