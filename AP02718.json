    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE shows 52.2% similarity toDiapause-specific peptide.Activity: Active against FUNGI such as S. cerevisiae (IC50 12 uM) but not bacteria. The peptide is inducible since mRNA level in fact body increased after yeast challege of larvae.",
