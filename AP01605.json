    "Literature": "Discovery: Sequence published initially by Kettenring et al. (1990) was corrected by NMR studies (Zimmermann et al 1995 Eur J Biochem 228: 786-97).Structure: Four thioether rings are S1-C6, T7-C12, T9-C17, AND T14-C19. In addition, the C-terminal thioether bridge has been oxidized to a sulfoxide. 3D structure was determined by the same group (Zimmermann and Jung 1997 Eur J Biochem 246: 809-19).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Activity: active against  S. aureus MetS ATCC 6538P (MIC 32 ug/ml), S. aureus MetS ATCC 19636 (MIC 32 ug/ml), S. aureus MetR L1400 (MIC 64 ug/ml), S. pyogenes SKF13400 (MIC 2 ug/ml), S. pneumoniae L44 (MIC 16 ug/ml), E.faecium VanS L568 (MIC 128 ug/ml), E.faecalis VanS L559 or  VanA L560 (MIC 128 ug/ml), E.coli ATCC 25922 (MIC >128 ug/ml), and C.albicans ATCC 90028 (MIC >128 ug/ml). Active against MRSA, VRE  (anti-VRE) and C. difficile.MOA: The molecule has a compact shape. Like mersacidin, this peptide inhibits cell wall biosynthesis by binding to lipid II.
