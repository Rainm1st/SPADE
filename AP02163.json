  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Active against Gram-positive bacteria A. globiformis, B. subtilis (MIC 0.5-0.9 uM) and Gram-negative bacteria E. coli and P. aeruginosa (MIC 0.5-1.9 uM). The peptide is helical in TFE, SDS, or DOPC LUVs. Recently, it was shown to inhibit C. trachomatis infection at an early stage (Lazarev VN,et al., 2013). Of note is that CIT1a retains its antibacterial activity when expressed as a fusion protein (Ali et al., 2014).",
