    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (45.5%) tobacterial P15s. Discovered from the human unconventional myosin 1h protein by computer prediction.Activity: Active against E. coli ATCC 25922 and 4 strains (MIC 1-2 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and 8 strains (MIC 1.67-8.2 uM), S. aureus ATCC 25923 and 3 strains (MIC 1-4.1 uM), E. faecalis ATCC 29212 (MIC 2-8.2 uM). In a different paper,it is showed to be active against S. epidermidis (MIC 1 uM), T. rubrum (MIC 8 uM), and C. albicans (MIC 1.67 uM).Toxicity: human RBC: not hemo.lytic (HC50 >128 uM).Structure: In DPC micelles, residues 3-14 of Hs02 adopted a helical structure.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Anti-inflammatory: HS02 suppressed the LPS-primed  release of TNF-alpha, thereby anti-inflammatory.
