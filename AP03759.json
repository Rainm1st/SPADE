  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Peptide design: the peptide was obtained by substituting each phenylalanine with leucine to study the difference between aromatic and aliphatic amino acids in this template.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (75%) toBMAP-28L: 33%; K: 39%; R: 17%. GRAVY: -1.07; M Wt:  2206.859; M formula: C101H196N34O20; Mol ex coeff: 0.Activity: Active against S. aureus MRSA (MIC 16 uM). Also inhibit biofilm formation at MBIC 16 uM and disrupted preformed biofilms at MBEC=8 uM.  Similar to LL-37, this variant has more effective anti-inflammatory activity (lower levels ofIL-6, MCP-1, and TNF-alpha) than BMAP-18.Toxicity: Sheep RBC: no hemolysis till 20 uM. low hemo.lytic (30% at 130 uM) with HC50 >130 uM. Cf.: mellitin caused nearly 100% hemolysis at ~10 uM. HC50 at 16-32 uM to RAW264.7 mouse macrophages.Structure: it became helical after binding to SDS or in 50% TFE.MOA:bacteria: it targets membranes, especially Gram- bacteria.",
