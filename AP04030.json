    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (66.67%) toMyxinidin H3KW: 25%; K: 33%. Multiple changes were made: G1K, H3K, H4W, G9W, P11W in myxinidin.Activity: active against Gram- E. coli ATCC 25922 or resistant CCARM 1229 or CCARM 1238 (MIC 1-4 uM), S. typhimurium KCTC 1926 or resistant CCARM 8009 or CCARM 8013 (MIC 2-16 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 or resistant 3592 or 5018 (MIC 4-8 uM), Gram+  S. aureus ATCC 25923 or resistant  CCARM 3114 or CCARM 3709 (MIC 0.25-16 uM), L. monocytogenes KCTC 3710 (MIC 4 uM). Myxinidin2 suppresses inflammatory responses through STAT3 and MAPKs to promote wound healing (Han HM et al., 2017).Structure: helical in anionic PG liposomes.",
