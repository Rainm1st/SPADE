K: 41%; F=G: 14%; GRAVY: -0.16; M Wt: 2478.163; Mol formula: C122H209N31O23.Activity: Of 411 aerobic isolates tested, 91% were susceptible to MSI-78 tested at a break-point of 64 ug/ml (Fucks et al., 1998). Active against Acinetobacter sp. 10 strains (MIC 4-8 ug/ml), A. faecalis 5 strains (MIC 4-64 ug/ml),  C. diversus 10 strains (MIC 8-16 ug/ml), C. freundii 25 strains (MIC 8->256 ug/ml), C. jeikeium (MIC 0.125-4 ug/ml), E. aerogenes 25 strains (MIC 8-16 ug/ml), E. cloacae 25 strains (MIC 1-128 ug/ml), E.faecalis 30 strains (MIC >256 ug/ml), E. coli 30 strains (MIC 8-16 ug/ml), K. oxytoca 10 strains (MIC 8-16 ug/ml), K. pneumoniae 25 strains (MIC 8-32 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa 25 strains (MIC 8-32 ug/ml), P. fluorescens 5 strains (MIC 2-8 ug/ml), P. stutzeri 5 strains (MIC 4-8 ug/ml), S. aureus MRSA 10 strains (MIC 16-64 ug/ml), S. aureus MSSA 15 strains (MIC 0.125-16 ug/ml), S. epidermidis 25 strains (MIC 0.125-8 ug/ml), S. haemolyticus 10 strains (MIC 408 ug/ml), S. hominis 5 strains (MIC 2-8 ug/ml), S. simulans 5 strains (MIC 0.125-2 ug/ml), S. warneri 5 strains (MIC 0.125-8 ug/ml), S. xylosus 1 strain (MIC 0.125 ug/ml or less),  S. maltophilia 10 strains (MIC 4-16 ug/ml), S. agalactiae 25 strains (MIC 16-32 ug/ml), S. bovis 5 strains (MIC 8-16 ug/ml), S. equinus 2 strains (MIC 2-16 ug/ml), S. pyogenes 30 strains (MIC 16-256 ug/ml), Streptococcus group C 5 strains (MIC 16-64 ug/ml), Streptococcus group G 5 strains (MIC 16-64 ug/ml), Viridans group streptococci 13 strains (MIC 4->256 ug/ml). Also anaerobic bacteria: B. fragilis 6 strains (MIC 4-8 ug/ml), B. ovatus 7 strains (MIC 4-8 ug/ml), B. ureolyticus 3 strains (MIC0.25-0.5 ug/ml), B. vulgatus 6 strains (MIC 4 ug/ml),  C. difficile 4 strains (MIC 0.5-4 ug/ml), C. perfringens 5 strains (MIC 8-32 ug/ml), C. ramosum 2 strains (MIC 16 ug/ml), C. sporogenes 2 strains (MIC8-32 ug/ml), Clostridium sp.

Also: C. albicans 10 strains (MIC 64->512 ug/ml). H. pylori.Toxicity: human RBC, 53% hemolysis at 512 ug/mL (HC50 512 ug/ml), less hemo.lytic.Structure: random in buffer but helical in POPC. ssNMR revealed in-plane orientation on lipid bilayer (Ramamoorthy et al., 2006).MOA: It works on bacterial membranes.Anti-inflammatory: toxic to U937 histiocytic cell line (tumor). TNF-alpha production due to LPS (lipopolysaccharide) stimulation was suppressed (Koszalka et al., 2011).Animal model:mouse:  Animal model:rat:  the peptide was release in pexiganan/colagen films (2.5% w/w) in 72 h. Treatment led to bacterial burden decrease in wounds of rats (Gopinath et al., 2005).Resistance development:no:bacteria: it did not develop resistance in multiple passage experiments when the number is small. However, more passages could induce resistance (ref?).Clinical trials: Pexiganan has wound healing activity. In 2 phase III multicentre randomised double-blind trials in diabetic patients with infected foot ulcers, both topical pexiganan acetate 1% and oral ofloxacin 800 mg/day achieved clinical cure or improvement in about 90% of patients. It was not approved by FDA due to the cytotoxicity issue.Entry history: The original has been merged with AP00763. This entry was split from its parent magainin entry AP144. 2/2023; 12/2024.",
