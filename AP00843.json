    "Literature": "Discovery: produced in the early exponential phase of growth and reached a maximum level at the beginning of the stationary phase.Chemical modification: two dislufide bonds: C10-C15 and C25-C43.Activity: characterized by high antilisterial activity. Of 24 tested strains of L. monocytogenes, 22 appeared to be sensitive to divergicin M35 (inhibition zone diameter: 10-22 mm). Also active against Carnobacterium spp. but inactive against L.lactis, subsp. l.biovar. diacetylatis UL719, P.acidilactici, P.pentosaceus, L.plantarum, L.acidophilus, L.salivarius, L.casei, L.rhamnosus, S.thermophilus, Propionibacterium spp., P.freudenreichii, B. breveand P.acidilactici UL5, E.coli.
