    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 76.9% similarity toAndroctonus defensin.Activity: Active against Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) : HBeAg (IC50 3.95 uM), HBsAg (IC50 = 2.28 uM) and HBV DNA (IC50 = 1.26 uM) in cell culture medium.  This is the first scorpion defensin that inhibits virus. In addition, this peptide can inhibit the growth of Gram+ S. aureus AB94004 or ATCC25923 or MRSA (MIC 0.08-0.63 uM), B. subtilis AB91021 (MIC 10 uM), B. thuringiensis AB92037 (MIC 20 uM), M. luteus AB93113 (MIC 0.16 uM), and S. epidermidis PRSE P1389 (MIC 0.31 uM). Similar to neurotoxin, it could also effectively inhibit Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.3 channel currents, and its IC50value for the Kv1.3 channel was 510.2 nm. Like classical scorpion potassium channel-blocking toxins, basic residues (K13 and R19) of BmKDfsin4 plays a critical role in inhibiting the Kv1.3 channel (Channel inhibitor) (Meng L et al., 2016). This is the first invertebrate defensin to block potassium channels.UPdated 7/2021; 11/2024",
