    "Literature": "A two-chain bacteriocion. The sequence of the complementary chain BrcB is KINWGNVGGSCVGGAVIGGALGGLGGAGGGCITGAIGSIWDQW. Chain A has an identical sequence to NKR-5-3A from E. faecium NKR-5-3 (Ishbashi N et al 2012 Biosci Biotechnol Biochem 76: 947-953). It inhited B. thermosphacta, Lactobacillus spp., Carnobacterium spp., Listeria spp., Enterococcus spp., Pediococcus spp., and Kurthia spp.(Note: The peptide is not active against Gram- bacteria since the outer membrane can inhibit its activity. however, it inhibited Gram-negative bacteria after EDTA treatment).
