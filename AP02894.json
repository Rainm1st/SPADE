    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide shows 18.4% similarity toScygonadin.  Molecular formula:  C674H1087N166O216S4; Mol Wt 15216.262; GRAVY= 0.064; Wimley-White whole-residue hydrophobicity of the peptide: 30.07   kcal/mol.Activity: Active against C. albicans ATCC 76615 (MIC 2 ug/nL). AntibiofilmF: In a seprate study, it was found to ahve activity against both planktonic and biofilms of C. neoformans (MIC 4-16 ug/ml; BIC80 16-32 ug/ml, and BEC80 64-128 ug/ml) (Yang et al., 2022). BIC=biofilm inhibition concentration; BEC=biofilm eradication concentration. Updated 2/2022; Net charge updated by APD 9/2022",
