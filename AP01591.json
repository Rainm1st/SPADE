  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Antimicrobial activities were evaluated using a C-terminally truncated synthetic 34mer. Canine beta-defensin displayed broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria (L. monocytogenes and S. aureus; MICs of 6 and 100 ug/ml, respectively), gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and N. gonorrhoeae; MICs of 20 to 50, 20, and 50 u/ml, respectively), and yeast (C. albicans; MIC of 5 to 50 u/ml) and lower activity against U. urealyticum and U. canigenitalium (MIC of 200 u/ml). Antimicrobial potency was significantly reduced at salt concentrations higher than 140 mM (i.e. salt-sensitive).  The exact role of the C-terminal regions of cBD-1, cBD-2, and cBD-3 remains to be established.",
