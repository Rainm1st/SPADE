    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (93.3%) tofrog Brevinin-2GHb, differing only in residues 4 (T vs. I) and 6 (A vs. T).Activity: Active against S. aureus (MIC 64 uM), E. coli (MIC 32 uM), and C. albicans (MIC 64 uM).Toxicity: Poor hemolysis HC50 = 700 uM. It can stimulate the release of insulin, thereby of interest for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Updated 7/2021",
