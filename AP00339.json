    "Literature": "Activity:  Active against Gram+ L. garvieae YT-3 (ATCC 49156) (MIC 10 uM), S. iniae F-8502 (MIC 2.5 uM), Gram- V. anguillarum ATCC 19264 (MIC 2.5 uM), Vibriopenaeicida KHA (MIC 10 uM), V. harveyi HUFP911 1 (ATCC 14126) (MIC 2.5 uM), V. vulnificus ET-7617(ATCC 33148) (MIC 5 uM), A-hydrophila ET-4 (MIC>40 uM), A. salmonicida NCMB 1102 (MIC 10 uM), P. putida ATCC 12633 (MIC 40 uM), and E-tarda ET-82016 (MIC>40 uM). Bactericidal activity (MLC): B. subtilis ATCC 6633 (MLC 0.25 uM) and E. coli WT-2 (MLC 0.25 uM). Minimal lethal concentrations (MLC) of peptide are given in uM and are the concentration of substance required necessary to kill ~ 99% of the bacteria. It kills cancer cells by disrupting membranes(Hsu JC,et al 2011).Antimicrobial robustness: Salt-insensitive: maintain activity up to 340 mM NaCl.Toxicity: highly hemolytic (HC50 ~1 uM).Structure:  CD: helical in the presence of 50% TFE. It contains an unusual C-terminal RRRH sequence.Surface immobilized peptide: Covalent immobilization of the peptide via a flexible linker results in 82 Â± 11% of bacteria being killed by the AMP. It remains active against E. coli and S. aureus after surface immobilization and a flexible linker, as well as right lenght, is needed (Ivanov et al., 2012;Lozeau et al., 2015).Found in multiple species.
