    "Literature": "Preserving food in the bird somach for several weeks during egg incubation. The disulfide bond pattern is identical to canonical beta-defensins from mammals. The high potency is related to its high cationicity as well as a hydrophobic patch, which is not observed in mammalian defensins.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.
