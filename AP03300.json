    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (81.08%) toEsculentin-2LTaGRAVY: 0.089; Mol formula: C169H281N45O48S3; M. Wt:   3820.542, and Mol ex coeff.: 1615 (cys-paired).Activity: C-terminal amidated form: active against Gram+ S. aureus MTCC 9542 or MRSA ATCC 43300 (MIC 1-3 uM), B. subtilis MTCC 14416 (MIC 7 uM), B. coagulans ATCC 7050 (MIC 10 uM),  VRE ATCC 29212 (MIC 10 uM), S. mutans MTCC 497 (MIC 7 uM), S.  gordonnii MTCC 2695 (MIC 5 uM), Gram- V. cholerae MCV09 (MIC 6 uM), E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 10 uM), fish pathogens A. hydrophilia (MIC 15 uM), A. sobria (MIC 1.5 uM).Toxicity:  human red blood cells (human RBC): The peptide is highly hemolytic with HC50=10-15 uM (amidated or not). Toxic to cancer cells Hep3B.SAR: C-terminal amidation enhanced bacterial killing (especially against Fish pathogens) but not hemolysis. Provided by Sanil George. Reg. 11/2021",
