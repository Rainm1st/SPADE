    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (81.82%) tocd4(Q5K,D9K)K=R: 19%, G: 16%, I: 13%. Designed by changing Q22 to K and D26 to A in KR-12 followed by connecting two copies of KR-12 with CPGG and GPGG.Activity: active against E. coli (MIC 0.312 uM) and P. aeruginosa (MIC 0.625 uM) in 10 mM tris buffer. Warning: other bacteria not tested.Structure: random coil in water and helical in lysoPG (78%).Peptide stability: CD4-PP gained stability to S. aureus protease aureolysin  (~20% detected after 6 h), while the control LL-37 was nearly completely degraded in 1 h.",
