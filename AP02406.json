    "Literature": "Sequence analysis:  ~30% similar toAP342:plant Mc-AMP1. Warning: position 39 is X in the original amino acid sequence. It is represented in A in this database.Activity: Active against Gram-negative bacteria E. coli (MIC 25-50 uM), V. harveyi (MIC 25-50 uM), V-parahaemolyticus (MIC>50 uM), P-aeruginosa (MIC > 50 uM), Gram-positive B. subtilis (MIC 1.2-1.5 uM), S. aureus (MIC 2.5-5.0 uM), S. luteus (MIC 1.2-1.5 uM), B. megaterium (2.5-5 uM), and fungi C. albicans (MIC 6.7-12.5 uM).Recombinant production:plants:Chlamydomonas reinhardtii: tantem repeat of this peptide (3X) was expressed and reached 0.28% of total soluble protein.In vitro toxicity: the recombinant form was active but did not show toxicity to HEK293 cells (Dong et al., 2018).Updated 12/2024",
