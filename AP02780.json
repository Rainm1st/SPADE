    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE shows 92.3% similarity toscorpion UyCT5.  Active against M. luteus (MIC 15 uM), S. aureus (30 uM),  and L. monocytogenes (MIC 15 uM). Also found to be active against P. silvatlantica (MIC 23.2 uM), Streptococcus sp. SP10 (clinical isolate) (MIC 23.2 uM), Streptococcus sp. ST9 (clinical isolate) (MIC 11.6 uM), S. aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC 23.2 uM) (Cesa-Luna C et al., 2019). The peptide showed poor hemolysis.
