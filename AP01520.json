  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: It contains a Pro-rich domain (PRD) at the N-terminus and a Cys-rich domain (PCD) at the C-terminus.Activity: This peptide showed weak activity (MIC 40-80 uM) against Gram- bacteria such asVibrio splendidus LGP132, V. penaecidae, V. nigripulchritudo, and strong activity against pathogenic fungus Fusarium oxysporum (MIC 2.5 uM).  In vitro test showed that it agglutinates bacteria (bacteria-agglutinating) and also binds LPS.SAR: Interestingly, both the monomer and dimer were obtained recombinantly and showed similar activity. The dimer is likely achieved via an intermolecular disulfide bond because this peptide contains 13 cysteines.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: His-tagged protein was purified via affinity column. The his-tag was then removed by cleaving the N-terminal Met using CNBr followed by gel filtration purification. Replaced 01/10. Formatted 11/2024",
