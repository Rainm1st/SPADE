    "Literature": "Activity: In medium A supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2 and 50 mM KCl, the peptide is active against fungi B. cinerea (IC50 12 ug/ml), C. sphaerospermum (IC50 3 ug/ml), F. culmorum (IC50 2.8-5 ug/ml), L. maculans (IC50 1.5 ug/ml), P. digitatum (IC50 2 ug/ml), S. tritici (IC50 1 ug/ml), and V. albo-atrum (IC50 4 ug/ml) (FEBS Lett. 1995 Jul 17;368(2):257-62).  It contains 4 S-S bonds.MOA:fungi: Binding of Dm-AMP1 to S. cerevisiae plasma membranes is required for antifungal activity of this protein (Mol Plant Microbe Interact. 2000;13:54-61). Specifically, it directly binds to mannosyldiinositolphosphoryl-ceramide [M(IP)2C], an acid complex sphigolipid (Thevissen K et al 2000 PNAS USA 97: 9531-6).Synergy:AMPs: It shows synergistic effects with BPTI (Bleackley MR et al., 2017). The lack of the gene that encodes the enzyme required for the synthesis of this lipid increased resistance against Dm-AMP1.Transgenic plants: expression of this peptide in Eggplant improves resistance to pathogens (Montesinos E 2007 FEMS Microbiol Lett 270, 1-11).
