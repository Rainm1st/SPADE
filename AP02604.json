  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide most resembles (50% similarity)scorpion Pandinin 2. Active against Gram+ S. aureus and S. agalactiaea and Gram-negative (E. coli and P. aeruginosa) as well yeasts C. albicans and C. glabrata.  Also active against M. tuberculosis H37Rv and M. tuberculosis MDR (anti-TB). It is much less hemolytic (HL50 167 uM) than VpAmp1.0 (HL50 9 uM). VpAmp2.1 is a shortened derivative (sequence: FWGFLGKLAMKAVPSLIGGNKK). Helical in 60% TFE.",
