    "Literature": "Discovery:  identified from Transcriptome analysis. p>Host expression: it is expressed in heart, stomach, muscle, gill, hepatopancreas and hemolymph after bacterial challenge.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is 36.36% similar toParalithocin 2C: 17%, G=P: 15%. GRAVY: -0.308; mol Wt: 4953.812; mol formula: C214H327N59O60S8; mol ex coeff: 13090.Activity: Active against Gram+ S. aureus MRSA (IC50 0.5 ug/ml_and S. agalactiae (IC50 ~0.5 ug/ml), gram- A. hydrophila (IC50 2 ug/ml), K. pneumoniae (IC50 0.5 ug/ml), and E. coli (IC50 0.25 ug/ml). IC50: estimated 50% growth inhibition.Animal model:zebrafish: it protected survival of zebrafish infected with a lethal dose of A. hydrophila. However, it showed no effect on infection when treated with the peptide.",
