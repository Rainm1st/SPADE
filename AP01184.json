    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: 76.47% similar to \tMucroporin, parent peptide (AP01327).SAR: Mucroporin-M1 was obtained by making the following mutations: G3R, P6K, G10K, and G11R, leading to enhanced activity.Activity: Mucroporin-M1 is active against E. coli AB94012 (MIC 12.5 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa AB93066 (MIC 100 ug/ml), B. thuringiensis AB92037 (MIC 25 ug/ml), B. subtilis AB91021 (MIC 25 ug/ml), S. aureus AB94004 (MIC 5 ug/ml), clincal stain 1538 (MRCNS) (5 ug/ml) as well as HIV-1. Also active against measles McV (EC50 7.15 ug/ml), SARS-CoV (EC50 14.46 ug/ml), and influenza A virus H5N1 (EC50 2.1 ug/ml) (Li et al., 2011).The original has been merged with AP01183.
