    "Literature": "Host expression:induced: elevated in gastric biopsy specimens from H. pylori-infected humans compared to those from uninfected humans.  Also, expression of S100A12 was significantly increased during P. aeruginosa corneal infections.AMP Significance: Bacterial keratitis is a leading cause of corneal blindness. S100A12 may be a therapeutic agent.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (33.63%) toS100A15L=K: 11%. GRAVY: -0.42; mol Wt: 10443.831; mol formula: C471H748N122O142; mol ex coeff: 2980.Activity: active against H. pylori. 750 ug/ml S100A12 protein, H. pylori growth was repressed by 40% and viability was decreased 1.5 log units. In addition, it inhibited (83%) S. pneumoniae at 250 ug/ml (23.9 uM) (Mishra et al., 2024), and Mycobaterium spp., S. aureus,  and C. jejuni .  It also inhibitedbiofilm formation:bacteria:P. aeruginosa (Mishra et al., 2022).Antivirulence:bacteria:P. aeruginosa:  Also exerted inhibitory activity against pyocyanin production.MOA:bacteria:H. pylori: S100A12 inhibited H. pylori via zinc chelation.Structure: helical in solution (CD) and in the crystal.You can rotate, zoom, and view the structureherein the PDB.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: purified protein was used in assays.Animal model:mouse: S100A12 attenuates P. aeruginosa PAO1 infection in a murine model of keratitis:eye cornea, topically treated at 0 and 6 h.Updated 10/2024",
