    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: Rich in P (29.4%).Host expression: Its host expression was induced by bacterial inoculation. Relish regulates expression of antimicrobial peptide genes in the honeybee, Apis mellifera, shown by RNA interference (Insect Mol Biol. 2007 Dec;16(6):753-9).Activity: Active against A. tumefaciens Gembloux A (MIC 25-50 ug/ml), E. salicis NCPPB 2530 (MIC 25-50 ug/ml), E. coli NCTC 9001 or NCTC 9001* or K524 (MIC 10-50 ug/ml), P. syringae pv. tomamta NCPPB 1105 (MIC 25-50 ug/ml), X. campestris pv. vesicatoria LMG 905 (MIC 5-10 ug/ml), and Gram-positive bacteria B. megaterium OMB 1551 (MIC 10-25 ug/ml), B.alvei LMG 6922 (MIC > 100 ug/ml), and M. luteus or M. lysodeikticus LMG 4050 (MIC 10-25 ug/ml). Thus, the highest observed specific activity of the peptide was against an apidaecin-resistant Xanthomonas strain.Antimicrobial robustness: abaecin was inactive in PBS at all concentrations tested.MOA:bacteria: In contrast to the immediate action of apidaecins, bactericidal activity of abaecin is delayed.APD Updated 10/2008; name corrected 5/2014; 7/2021; 10/2023 GW.",
