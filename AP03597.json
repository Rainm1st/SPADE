Mol Wt:  4283.225; GRAVY: -0.59; Mol Formula: C177H303N65O44S7; mol ex coeff: 3355.Activity: killed 99.9% E. coli (11.3 ug/ml) and S. aureus (11.0 ug/ml) based on virtual colony count assays. This method exposed bacteria to peptides for 2 h in 10 mM phospahtate buffer before incubating in media for 12 h.",
