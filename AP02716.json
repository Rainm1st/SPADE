  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE shows 94.1% similarity toAndersonin-W2.Activity: Active against E. coli (MIC 30 uM). A change of the last K to F reduced activity (MIC 160 uM). CKAAFC itself is not antimicrobial. The peptide contains a canonical Kunitz-type protease inhibitor motif (-CKAAFC-), thereby named as kunitzins. RE is the abbreviation of the frog Latin name. Effective inhibitor of trypsin with a Ki 5.5 uM.",
