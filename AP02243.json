    "Literature": "Chemical modification: The second and seventh residues of this cyclic peptide are Ornithines, an analog of lysine (one CH2 shorter). They are represented here with lysines. In addition, residue F is a D-amino acid. Even earlier reports are in Russian. Sergiev PG summarized some results on the peptideScience_direct. See also Biochem J. 1945;39(4):363-7.Pub-Med.Structure: Both X-ray and NMR have been used for stuctural studies (NMR+x).Activity: bactericidal: active against 15 strains E. faecium (MIC 3.9 ug/ml), 15 S. aureus (MIC 3.9-7.8 ug/ml), E. cloacae (MIC 1.95-62.5 ug/ml), 15 P. aeruginosa (MIC 31.2-62.5 ug/ml), 15 K. pneumoniae (MIC 7.8-62.5 ug/ml), and 15 A. baumannii (MIC 31.2-62.5 ug/ml) (Swierstra et al., 2016).Synergy:AMPs:It shows synergistic effects with polymyxin B against P. aeruginosa (Berditsch et al., 2015).Antimicrobial robustness:  KCl-sensitive:E. coli: 100 mM salt MIC changed 4 fold.AMPs in use: This is the first cyclic peptide antibiotic used clinically.  Gramicidin S was used to treat wounds and is still in use in topical ointments and eye drops.  The peptide has antibiofilmB effect on E. faecalis (Jayaraman A et al., 1999) and has been successfully treated infected root canals of patients (Berditsch et al., 2016).
