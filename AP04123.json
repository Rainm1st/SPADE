  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (64.29%) toTemporin-GHL: 31%; K: 23%.Activity:  Active against T. mentagrophytes (MIC 62.5 ug/ml).  Inhibits spore germination in a peptide dose-dependent manner. Also, ACP5 inhibited spore germination completely at 1×MIC in 12h.Toxicity: non-toxic to mouse fibroblasts at less than 8×MIC. 50% viable (IC50) at 500 ug/ml.Resistance development:no:fungi:T. mentagrophytes:  T. mentagrophytes did not develop resistance to ACP5 after 5 passages but terbinafine did.MOA:fungi:T. mentagrophytes: permeated membranes, ROS increased, decreased mitochondrial memrbane potential.Animal model:Guinea pigs: Since mice are not susceptible to T. mentagrophytes infection, Guinea pigs were used as an animal model. Toxicity: no clear histologic changes, negligible change in body wt with and without drug, indicating poor toxicity treated at 1%. However, the treatment effect was evident and comparable to 1% terbinafine.",
