  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: The primary structure, as well as the mode of intrabonds, of the peptide has been revised based on a combined analytical techniques  (Maffioli SI et al 2009). The updated sequence before post translation is diaplayed.Chemical modification:  Residues T2 and S5 are dehydrated. Lanthionines occur between S3-C7, S13-C20, S18-C23, and S21-C24. One methyllanthionine is proposed between T8 and C11. In addition, the carboxylic acids of E14 and the C-terminus are benzylamidated. The peptide is not active against E.coli and C.albicans, but is active against Gram-negative pathogenic bacterium M. catarrhalis (MIC 1 ug/ml). It inhibits cell wall synthesis of Gram-positive bacteria, including S. aureus MRSA.Structure:  3D structure has been determined by NMR (Vasile F et al., 2012).Updated 5/2014; 7/2021.",
