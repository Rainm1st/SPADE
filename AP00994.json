    "Literature": "As noted by Ric Stange,  the original sequence is GIFSNMYXRTPAGYFRGPXGYXXN. That is to say, the types of amino acids at positions 8, 19, 22, and 23 have not been determined yet. To facilitate APD registration, these unknown residues are represented here by Ala (seq incomplete).Activity:  It showed antimicrobial activity against bacteria such as C. michiganensis (EC50=1 uM) and R. solanacearum (EC50=6 uM) and fungi  F. solani (EC50 = 11 uM).Antimicrobial robustness: salt-sensitive: activity is abolished in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2 + 50 mM KCl.
