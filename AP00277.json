    "Literature": "His content 17% (His-rich renoved 2022).Activity: Active against E. coli  ML-35p,  L. monocytogenes  EGD  and  C. albicans  in  radial  diffusion  assays (dose dependent, see Fig. 6 in the ref). Recent microdilution assays revealed that the MIC value was reduced 32 fold against E. faecalis ATCC 29212 (MIC 8 ug/ml) in the presence of metals (Zn2+ or Cu2+), while the activity against C. albicans ATCC 10231 (MIC 64 ug/ml) was essentially not changed (64-128 uM) in the presnece of Zn2+ or Cu2+ (Miller et al., 2023) (Provided by Adriana Miller).virus: inhibited Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 HIV-1 (EC50 7.1 uM).Toxicity: TC50 37.1 uM in CEM-SS cells.
