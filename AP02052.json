  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Chemical modification: Warning: this peptide contains non-natural amino acids although they are represented using the closest standard 20 amino acids. Specifically, T1, T8, T17, and T18 are dehydrated into Dhb.  P12 is 3,4-dehydrated (Dhp). In total, five residues are dehydrated. Residue K20 is Dab (2,4-diaminobutyric acid). Finally, the acyl chain CH(3)-(CH(2))(6)-CH(OH)-CH(2)-CO is attached to the N-terminus. Thus, the entire sequence is CH(3)-(CH(2))(6)-CH(OH)-CH(2)-CO-Dhb-Pro-Ala-Leu/Ile-Ala-Val-Val-Dhb-Thr-Val-Leu/Ile-Dhp-Ala-Ala-Ala-Val-Dhb-Dhb-Ala-Dab-Ser-Val-OH. Note that residues 4 and 11 can be either L or I.Activity: Active against the fungal pathogen S. sclerotiorum that infects plants. Updated 7/2021",
