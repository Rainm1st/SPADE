The primary structure was reported in 1997 byForssmann U and colleagues. Three C-terminal truncated variants with 73, 75, and 76 residues were isolated as well. NMR structure (73 residues) was solved in 2000 (go to the PDB link).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.  Reg 12/10/2014.",
