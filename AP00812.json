    "Literature": "A degradation product of proenkephalin-A corresponding to residues 209-237 where S221 and S223 are phosphorylated. Endogenous biphosphorylated peptide is antibacterial but not synthetic form. Active against M. luteus and B. megaterium (MIC 0.2-0.4 uM) but not E.coli. Diphosphorylation is important for activity since no or mono-phosphorylated peptide was inactive. Updated 7/2021",
