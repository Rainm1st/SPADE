AvBD7 is active against Gram-positive bacteria (B. Subtilis, B. cereus, S. aureus, S. haemolyticus, S. saprophyticus, L. monocytogenes) and Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. Enteritidis ATCC 13076, S. Enteritidis LA5, E. cloacae, K. pneumoniae) with a MIC in the range of 0.110-0.33 uM. Updated 4/2019",
