  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Host expression:induced:The peptide is induced via the IMD pathway.Activity: active against E. coli K12 or NIHJ (MIC 6.3 ug/ml), S. sonnei JS11746 (MIC 12.5 ug/ml), and P. uulgaris OX19 (MIC 6.3 ug/ml). The recombinant form is active against E. coli C600 (MIC 0.2 ug/ml), B. megaterium BKM 41 (MIC 1.0 ug/ml), and P. aeruginosa PAO1 (MIC 0.5 ug/ml).SAR: the N-terminal 2 residues are critical for killing E. coli and neutralizing LPS (Kazuo Okemoto et al., 2002).Structure: The peptide contains two amphipathic alpha helices: helix I (3-23) and helix II (28-38), with a hinge region (G24-I27) (NMR: Iwai H et al., Eur. J. Biochem.1993;  217: 639-644).Plant protection:tobacco: Transgenic plants: expression of this peptide in tobacco confers partial resitance to pathogens (Montesinos E 2007 FEMS MIcrobiol Lett 270: 1-11).Recombinant production:yeast:Saccharomyces cerevisiae: the peptide expressed is active against plant pathogens.Also, recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli expression has been reproted (Vitaly S Skosyrev et al., 2003).Recombinant production:plants:Nicotiana tabacum: direct expression didn't lead to detectable peptide, but expression as a fusion protein is useful.Discovery: Found in multiple species. The AA sequence of Cecropin A2 from Drosophila melanogaster is identical to the major cecropin (Sarcotoxin IA) from Sarcophaga peregrina. Also, expressing it in orange Produces High-Quality Fruit and Shows Tolerance to bacterium 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' (Talita Vigo Longhi et al., 2022). Updated 7/2021; Jan2023",
