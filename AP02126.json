    "Literature": "Activity: Active against S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli (MIC 6-15 uM).  UyCT3 shares 100% homology with OcyC1 from O. cayaporum (Ischnuridae). Active against C. albicans SC5314 (MIC 25 uM), C. tropicalis ATCC 750 (MIC 25 uM), C. neoformans H99 serotype A (MIC 25 uM), and C. neoformans B3501 serotype D (MIC 12.5 uM). It also showed weak antibiofilmF activity against initial adherence of C. albicans at 100 uM but poor activity against the mature biofilm 400 uM (Guilhelmelli F et al., 2016).  Found in multiple species. Updated 12/2016.",
