  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "A synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 36 aa was found to be active against G+ and G- bacteria. G- bacteria are E. coli ATCC25922, Aeromonas salmonicida MT004, A. salmonicida MT423, Photobacterium damsela MT1415, P. damsela EPOY 8803 II, Vibrio anguillarum MT1741 or MT1742, Yersinia ruckeri MT252 with the MICs in the range of 2-20 uM. G+ bacteria are Lactococcus garvieae MT2055 (MIC 40 uM) and MT2291 (MIC 2 uM).",
