  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (97.92%) toDermcidinIt has one additional leucine at the C-terminus compared to DCD-1. Mol Wt: 4818.483; Mol formula: C210H359N57O71; GRAVY:- 0.029.Activity: Active against E. coli (MBC 10 ug/ml), E. faecalis (MBC 10 ug/ml), S. aureus (MBC 10 ug/ml), and C. albicans (MBC 100 ug/ml). Activity was evaluated under non-standard assay conditions: incubate 4h in PBS first.Antimicrobial robustness:  DLD-1L showed antimicorbial activites similar to DCD-1 but appeared to be more sensitive to salt conditions (salt-sensitive): NaCl-sensitive:E. coli (100 mM).Structure:  NMR structural analysis of dermcidin-1L in 50% TFE using an N15-labeled recombinant peptide reveals a long helix-hinge-helix motif, allowing it to associate with bacterial membranes (Jung et al. 2010 BMB Rep. 43: 362-8) (View NMR structure).You can rotate, zoom, and view the hexameric crystal structureherein the PDB.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: recombinant peptide was used in structural studies. In another study, the recombinant peptide is helical in 50% TFE or SDS and kills E. coli CMCC(B)44102 (LC50 1.8 ug/ml), P. sputita (LC50 0.5 ug/ml), S. aureus CMCC(B)26003 or 293 (IC50 8.2-17.8 ug/ml), and C. albicans CMCC(B)98001 (IC50 12.6 ug/ml) (Lai et al., 2005).Toxicity: not hemo.lytic at 100 uM.Entry history: The original peptide maculatin 1.1.1. was replaced due to its MIC >100 uM.
