    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: Shepherin I and Shepherin II are two unique gly-rich AMPs (~65%) generated from the same precursor protein using different polypeptide regions. Due to multiple His residues, their net charge depend on pH.Activity:  active against Gram-  E. herbicola (IC50 25 ug/ml), E. coli (IC50 <2.5 ug/ml), P. putida(IC50 <2.5 ug/ml), P. syringae (IC50 <2.5 ug/ml), S.  typhimurium (IC50 65 ug/ml), Serratia sp. (IC50 <2.5 ug/ml),  Gram+ B.subtilis (IC50 >100 ug/ml), S.aureus (IC50 >100 ug/ml), S.mutans (IC50 >100 ug/ml), fungi C. albicans (IC50 5 ug/ml),   C.  neoformans (IC50 <2.5 ug/ml),  S. cerevisiae (IC50 3 ug/ml),  A.alternata (IC50 >100 ug/ml),  A. flavus (IC50 60 ug/ml),  A.fumigatus (IC50 >100 ug/ml), and F. culmorum (IC50 68 ug/ml).MOA:fungi: the peptide changes structure in complex with Zn2+. This metal binding triggers the formation of fibril, which is antifungal. Note that no anticandidal activity was found in the presence of Cu2+ or for the free peptide (Szarszon et al., 2024).Structure:  In TFE, no ordered structure was found by CD.Entry history:  The original entry has been replaced.
