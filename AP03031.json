    "Literature": "Discovery:  APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 71.4% similarity toEsculentin-IGRa. GRAVY: -0.077; Mol Wt: 5006.971; Mol formula: C225H380N63O61S2; Mol ex. Coeff: 5675;Structure:  Random in water but helical bound to SDS (30-120 mM) and in 50 uM LPS. bind to D-(+)-Galacturonic acid and LPS (BBL).Activity: Active against E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 3.7 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 50 uM), Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 25923 or ampicillin and benzylpencillin-resistant (MIC 1.9-40 uM), P. acnes (MIC 1.17 uM), S. subtilis ATCC 6633 (MIC 3.1 uM), and C. albicans (MIC 4.7 uM). Killed E. coli ATCC 25922 in 180 min at 2 or 4xMIC.Antimicrobial robustness:  The MIC of the peptide (3.75 uM) increased slightly with an increase in salt (7.5 uM at 150 mM and 11.67 uM at 400 mM): NaCl-sensitive:E. coli. Also, the MIC increased to 11.67 uM after heating at a temperture below 90oC: temperture-sensitive. Serum-sensitive: 25% Serum: MIC increased to 40 uM.Other activities:  Anti-inflammatory: It also inhibits LPS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory nitric oxide (NO), interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor while enhances expression of interleukin-10. Antioxidant: It also showed antioxidant effect (Zeng et al., 2020).Antiviral: This peptide also inhibits influenza A virus (IAV) infection.MOA:virus:  inhibits the entry of strains H5N1 and H1N1 (IC50 1.29 nd 4.59 uM) (Yang et al., 2021).SAR: Esculentin-1GN(1-24)NH2, a C-terminally truncated peptide (GLFSKKGGKGGKSWIKGVFKGIKG-amide) with a net charge of +8 and reduced hydrophobc content (29%), showed increase LPS binding but reduced activity against E. coli.
