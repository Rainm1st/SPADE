    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 47.6% similarity toMicrocin J25. GRAVY: 0.368; Mol Wt: 1899.18; mol formula: C88H135N23O24; molar extinction coefficient: 2980.Activity: Active against E. coli BW25113 or BL21 or MG1655 (MIC 31-100 uM), enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 strain TUV93-0 (MIC 16 uM), S.enterica serovar newport (MIC 1000 uM), and Citrobacter clinical isolate (MIC 125 uM). Interestingly, citrocin is more potent against a pathogenic strain of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) than it is against laboratory strains of E. coli.  P. aeruginosa (MIC 0.3 mg/ml).  Also inhibited biofilm formation at sub-MIC and disrupted preformed biofilms at higher MIC.SAR:  A change of R17 to Y made the peptide inactive.Chemical modification:   Similar to microcin J25, it has an eight aa residue ring formed between the backbone NH of residue Gly1 and the side chain CO of residue Glu8.MOA:bacteria: This peptide must cross both the outer membrane and the inner membrane to find a cytoplasmic target such as RNA polymerase (RNAP), which citropin is good at inhibiting in vitro. It has an activity spectrum and mechanism of action different from Microcin J25. Found in multiple species.  In addition, it controlled P. aeruginosa biofilms:bacteria by breaking down extracellular polysaccharide (Wang et al., 2024).Structure: NMR study reveals that the C-terminal tail is sterically locked into place with Arg-17 above the ring and Tyr-18 below the ring.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. Residues 2-7 is annotated as a beta-strand.Recombinant production:yeast:Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sa-10: established.Feed additive: it is used in animal feed (0.1-0.5 g/t) (Wang et al., 2024).Updated Jan2020; 7/2021; 12/2023; 4/2024",
