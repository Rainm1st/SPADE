    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 40% similarity toTEWP.17% C; 17% K, 12% R. Mol Wt: 4609.393; GRAVY: -1.47;  mol formula: C182H312N66O58S8.Activity: Weakly active against E. coli CICC23657 at 100 uM, killing 36.9% and no activity against S.aureus at 100 uM.Structure: Ovodefensins have a conserved motif: C-X3-C-X3-C-X11-C-X4-CC. The disulfide bond pattern is proposed to be C1–C4, C2–C5, C3–C6. One additional cysteine can allow the formation of intermolecular dimers. Updated 3/2019; 7/2021",
