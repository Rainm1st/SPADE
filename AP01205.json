    "Literature": "Chemical modification:  Lactocin S is the first prokaryotic exception to the rule that only L-amino acids are included in ribosomally synthesized peptideS. Three L-serines were found to be D-alanines (J Biol Chem. 1994;269:27183-5). The N-terminal S is blocked since it has been converted to a pyruvamide form. T2 is dehydrated to Dhb. S7, S11, and S19 were converted to D-alanine by an enzyme.Two thioether rings: S23-C28 and S32-C37.Activity: synthetic peptide inhibited the growth of P. acidilactici Pac 1.0 similar to the isolated form (Ross et al., 2010).
