    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (71.43%) toHH235W: 33%, R: 25%; P: 17%.Activity: active against Gram+ E. faecalis PCM 2673 (MIC 16 ug/ml), S. aureus ATCC 25923 or 9144 (MIC 16 ug/ml), S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 (MIC 8 ug/ml), Gram- E. coli ATCC 25922 or 23506 (MIC 16-32 ug/ml), K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 (MIC 8 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027 (MIC 16 ug/ml), fungi  A. niger ATCC 16404 (MIC 64 ug/ml), C.albicans ATCC 10231 (MIC 128 ug/ml), and C.glabrata ATCC 15126 (MIC 128 ug/ml).In vitro toxicity: 4% human RBC: < 10% hemolysis at 512 ug/ml.Structure:  features TBA.Animal model:rats: Wound healing: Omiganan-alone and combined with imipenem-was associated with a better control of inflammatory parameters than imipenem alone.Clinical trials: Indolicidin derivatives were subjected to clinical trials. In a recent phase 2 clinical trial (topical, twice a day for 28 days), omiganan reduces S. aureus and increases microbial diversity,  but did not improve clinical sympotoms of patients with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis (AD), indicating inadequcy of this mono-treatment (van der Kolk et al., 2020).",
