    "Literature": "Toxicity:  the peptide is highly hemolytic to pig RBC erythrocyte (ED50 2.8 ug/ml).Structure:  helical structure in TFE may be responsible for membrane activity. Different from Bombolitin I, Bombolitin III is helical in aqueous at 1.3 mM. This helical structure in water is pH dependent (pH 3.5 less), likely from aggregation. updated 5/2020",
