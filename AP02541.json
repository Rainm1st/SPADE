  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence  is 92.9% similar tosaBD. This computer predicted sequence ASFPWSCLSLSGVCRKVCLPTELFFGPLGCGKGSLCCVSHFL is active against E. coli DH5alpha and S. agalactiae GBS. The results indicate that Onbeta-defensin plays a role in immune responses that suppress or kill pathogens. Further studies using an antibody/Western blot identified a mature peptide with a molecular weight 4293.2, corresponding to residues 27-66. This requires the shortening of the N-terminus of the predicted peptide by two residues (removal of AS), leading to a mature sequence as shown (Chang C et al., 2017)). Updated Jan2017 GW.",
