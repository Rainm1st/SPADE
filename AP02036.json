    "Literature": "Activity: Active against A. helianthi (IC50 5-10 ug/ml), C. paradoxa (IC50 20-50 ug/ml), C. nicotianae (IC50 5-10 ug/ml), C. elegans (IC50 2-5 ug/ml), F. oxysporum (IC50 10 ug/ml), L. maculans (IC50 25 ug/ml), S. sclerotiorum (IC50 20-50 ug/ml), V. dahliae (IC50 5-10 ug/ml), S. cerevisiae (IC50 20-50 ug/ml), P. cryptogea (IC50 5-10 ug/ml), P. parasitica nicotianae (IC50 10-20 ug/ml), C. michiganensis (IC50 50 ug/ml), R-solanacearum (IC50>50 ug/ml), and E-coli (IC50>50 ug/ml).Also exerted nematocidal activity against C. elegans.Antimicrobial robustness: CaCl2-sensitive: The 50% growth inhibition activities to most of the strains are reduced in the presence of Calcium chloride (1 mM).AMP Significance: The release of antimicrobial peptides into seed exudates is perhaps importance for macadamia seeds to germinate in a natural habitat of moist, microbially rich soils in subtropical and tropical forests.
