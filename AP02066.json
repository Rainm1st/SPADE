    "Literature": "Activity: Application of Pm-AMP1 resulted in visible hyphal growth inhibition of C. ribicola, P. sulphurascens, O. montium, and O. clavigerum 3-12 days post-treatment. Pm-AMP1 also inhibited spore germination of several other phytopathogenic fungi by 32%-84% 5 days post-treatment (Can J Microbiol. 2011). It confers resistance to multiple fungal pathogens in canola (Brassica napus)  (Plant Mol Biol. 2012). Updated 7/2021",
