    "Literature": "These H. pulchellus (Hp) peptides (AP2385 to AP2387) were named based on peptide identification number. There are 23% glycines and 19% prolines in the sequence.  Active against S. aureus (MIC 8 uM) and E. coli (MIC 13 uM). There are more peptides reported in this peptidomic study. Their activity data are not available.",
