  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "The peptide is expressed as a 63mer precursor. The leader sequence was removed and a covalent link of the N and C-termini led to the mature peptide. This bacteriocin inhibits other Gram-positive bacteria. The cyclic structure of the peptide confers stability to heat (80-100oC), pH (2-10) and proteases (trypsin, pepsin, papain and proteinase K). This peptide uses a maltose ABC transporter as the receptor since the gene KO made it 6-11 fold less sensitive. Sensitivity to GarML increased significantly when wild-type cells were grown on maltose and galactose as sole carbohydrates (carbon catabolite repression), an effect which was alleviated by the presence of glucose (Gabrielsen C et al., 2012). The authors think that this is the first example where a protein complex is involved in antimicrobial senstivity. UPdated 5/2014; 10/2017.",
