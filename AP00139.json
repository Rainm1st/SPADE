    "Literature": "History: This is the first inducible insect antimicrobial peptide fully characterized by Boman and colleagues. The paper was re-produced in J Immunol. 2009 Jun 1;182(11):6635-72 as a pillar article in immunology. Also read the comment of this work by JL Strominger (2009 Immunol 182:6633-4).Activity: Active against insect pathogens S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa, X. nematophilus, E. coli K12, and B. megaterium, no inhibition: B.subtilis (inhibition zone assays). ActivityG: D=L.Antimicrobial robustness:  heat-stable after 30 min treatment at 100oC, but can be cleaved by proteases.Toxicity:  Not hemo.lytic at 100 uM. Not hemolytic to sheep RBC (LC>200 uM).Structure: sequence validated 11/2023. 2D NMR studies revealed two helical domains (Helix1: 5-21; Helix2: 24-37) (Holak TA et al. 1988 Biochemistry 27:7620-7629).MOA:virus:  It also inhibits HIV by suppressing viral gene expression (J Gen Virol 1998; 79:731-40).Transgenic plants: expression of this peptide in rich improved plant resistance to pathogens (Plant Biotechnol J. 2008 Aug;6(6):585-608).Updated 7/2021; 10/2023; 11/2023; 4/2025",
