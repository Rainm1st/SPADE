  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Cellular location: accumulated in vacuole and processed likely by asparaginyl endoproteinase (Conlan BF et al. 2011 Am J Bot 98:2018-26).Discovery: First isolated by Gran in 1973 (Acta Pharmacol Toxicol (Copenh). 1973;33(5):400-8).Activity: antimicrobial activity was demonstrated in 1999, thereby establishing it as an AMP. Active against GRam- E.coli (MIC >500 uM), P.aeruginosa (MIC> 500 uM), P.vulgaris (MIC >500 uM), K. oxytoca (MIC 54.8 uM), Gram+ S. aureus (MIC 0.26 uM), M. luteus (MIC 40.4 uM), fungi C.albicans (MIC > 500 uM), C. kefyr (MIC 21.4 uM), and C.tropicalis (MIC >500 uM) (see ref). Also, it inhibited HIV-1 infection in cultured human T-lymphoblast (CEM-SS) cells (EC50 140 nM) and cytotoxicity (TC50 3500 nM), therapeutic index (25)(Ireland et al., 2008).  Kalata B1 also has uterotonic and insecticidal activity (natural pesticide).Also exerted nematocidal activity (Bajpai et al., 2023).Antimicrobial robustness: Antibacterial activity was salt dependent: NaCl-sensitive:S. aureus (100 mM); NaCl-sensitive:M. luteus (100 mM); NaCl-sensitive:K. oxytoca (100 mM).Structure: the circular structure was established in 1995 (Saether O, et al.). There are other PDB entries: 1JJZ, 1NB1, and 1ZNU.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 4TTM structureherein the PDB.MOA:bacteria:  An all D-analog is also active (D=L), supporting membrane targeting (Sando L. et al. 2011 Chembiochem 12: 2456-62). NMR studies of the ternary complex identified amino acid residues in loop 5 (W23, P24, and V25) and loop 6 (L2, P3, and V4) are important for membrane binding (Shenkarrev ZO et al. 2006 FEBS J 273:2658-72). It binds to phosphatidylethanolamine and leads to pore formation (41-70 A) in lipid bilayers (Huang et al 2009 JBC 284: 20699-20707). Oligomerization on the membrane surface could be important for this process.SAR: The overall fold is important for anti-HIV activity, since the acyclic permutant is inactive.  Note that oxidized forms of this peptide have also been reported. Trp can be oxidized to oxindolylalanine I (oia) or N-formylkynurenine (nfk). The effect of such oxidation on activity is unknown (Plan MR et al 2007 Chembiochem 8:1001-11). It also inhibits the human prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) (Hellinger R et al., 2015).Peptide formulation: nanofiber formulated form is also active (Bas et al., 2023).Updated Jan2010; 11/2011; Jan2012; 3/2012; reference updated 5/2013; 2/2016; 7/2021; 8/2023; formated 11/2023; 11/2024",
