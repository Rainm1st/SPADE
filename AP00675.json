  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Host expression:induced: Like hBD2 and hBD3, the expression of hBD4 can be induced.Activity: Active against E. coli ATCC 25922, E. faecalis.Antimicrobial robustness:  Activity is salt-sensitive. The S-S bridges are not needed for antibacterial activity.Structure: Crystal structure reveals an usual conformation at the N-terminus, explaining why hBD4 does not induce CCR6-mediated chemotaxis (Prahl A et al., 2017).Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: codon optimized, pET32 thioredoxin fusion expression at 2.68 g/L, IPTG induced, enterokinase cleavage, matured hBD4 0.689 g/L. Active against E. coli K12 D31 and P. aeruginosa (inhibition zone).  Recombinant production2: Genetic modification was used to ectopically express human beta defensin 4 in cultured primary epidermal keratinocytes (Smiley et al., 2007).Resistance mechanism:   In HEK293 cells, Mycobacterium tuberculosis uses dehydrogenating L-alanine to suppress this AMP expression (Peng et al., 2024).Updated 3/2017; 3/2018; 3/2023; 5/2024; 4/2025",
