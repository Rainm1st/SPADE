    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: Warning: Only the N-terminal sequence is provided. The peptide has a molecular mass of 5,158.11 Da. APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (76.2%) toBac-GM100.Antimicrobial robustness: The peptide is heat-stable (20 min at 120 °C) and pH stable (3-9), resistant to the proteolytic action of trypsin, pepsin, papain, pronase E, and proteinase K (protease-insensitive).Activity: Active against Gram+ M. luteus LB 14110, S. aureus ATCC 6538, L. ivanovii BUG 496, E. faecalis JH 2-2, Gram- bacteria E. coli ATCC 8739, S. typhimurium, A. tumefaciens C58, P. savastanoi pv. savastanoi, P. aeruginosa ATCC 49189,  fungistatic against C. tropicalis R2 CIP203 and Fusarium. sp. based on inhibition zone 13-33 mm).",
