    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (90%) toM6K=R: 20%, others 10%.Peptide engineering:  the peptide is a branched form constructed on the platform of lysine to increase in vivo life time.  Warning: This dendrimer contains 4 chains of the same sequence shown.Activity: active against E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 16 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 16 ug/ml), and S-aureus ATCC 29213 (MIC >64 ug/ml).",
