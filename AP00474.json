  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: fish pathogens S. iniae (MIC 2.51 uM), L. garvieae (MIC 20.07 uM), V. anguillarum (MIC 2.51-5.02 uM), A-salmonicida (MIC >80.26 uM), human pathogens E. faecalis (MIC 1.26 uM), S. flexneri (MIC 20.07 uM), and E. coli (MIC 80.26 uM).Viruses: It is active against channel catfish virus (CCV), frog virus 3 (FV3) (Chinchar VG et al. Virol. 323:268-275).Structure:  It probably adopts an amphipathic alpha helical conformation.SAR: it can exist in both amidated and non-amidated forms.  This peptide also binds to metal Cu2+ (Rai et al., 2018).  Zn2+ and Cu2+ binding increases the activity of piscidin 3 but not piscidin 1 or 2 (Adriana et al., 2024).
