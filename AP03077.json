    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 83.3% similarity tosnake Cathelicidin-BF. 40% Lys, 16% Phe, and 13% Val. Mol Formula, C179H294N44O33; mol wt, 3590.535 Da, theoretical pI, 11.04; GRAVY, -0.386; structure predicted to be helical.Activity: Active against Gram- E. coli ATCC25922 or clinical strain (MIC 5.22-20.88 uM), S. dysenteriae clinical strain (MIC 10.44 uM), K. peneumoniae clinical strain (MIC 10.44 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC27853 (MIC 10.44 uM), Gram+ S. aureus ATCC25923 (MIC 20.88 uM), B. cereus clinical strain (MIC 1.3 uM), B. subtilis clinical strain (MIC 5.22 uM), E. faecium clinical strain (MIC 10.44 uM), N. asteroides clinical strain (MIC 10.4 uM), fungi  C. albicans (MIC 5.22-10.44 uM) and C. glabrata clinical strains (MIC 10.4 uM). In addition, SA-CATH showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the biofilm formation of E. coli clinical strain. It also inhibited the LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokines NO, TNF-alpha, and IL-6, thereby anti-inflammatory.Toxicity: Yet, this peptide showed poor toxicity to mammalian cells (HaCaT) and poorly hemo.lytic to human RBCs (5.12% at 200 ug/ml).
