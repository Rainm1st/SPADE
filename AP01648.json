  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Pelteobagrin exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as fungi, including S. aureus ATCC6538,  B. subtilis ATCC6633 (MIC 2-4 uM), E. coli ATCC25922 (MIC 16 uM), and C. albicans ATCC2002 (MIC 64 ug/ml), and the activity was relatively salt-insensitive in the presence of 137 mM NaCl and only became inactive at 274-548 mM. The peptide showed no hemolytic activity to rabbit red blood cells. It probably acts on bacterial cell wall and membranes. 11/18/2010; 11/2015.",
