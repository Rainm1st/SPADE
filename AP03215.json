  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (95%) toPhylloseptin-1. Note that the last residue G in Phyloseptin-S1 is converted to amide in Phylloseptin-1 from a different species. Thus, these two peptides are essentially the same as can be seen from the similar activity spectrum.Activity: Active against E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 70 uM) and S. aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC 6.3 uM).",
