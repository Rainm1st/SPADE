    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 96.4% similarity toDermaseptin-DI2.14% L and K, 21% A and 10% N. Mol Wt: 2912.439; GRAVY: 0.15;  mol formula: C129H223N34O37S1.Activity: Active against S. aureus MRSA (MIC 4 uM) and E. coli (MIC 4 uM) and C. albicans (MIC 4 uM). DRS-DU-1 was twofold more potent against K. pneumoniae (MIC 4 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 4 uM) and E. faecalis (MIC 64 uM) than DRS-CA-1.Toxicity: horse RBC: HC50 216 uM, hemo.lytic. Also had a selective effect on cancer cells (H157 and PC-3, IC50 8.43 and 21.6 uM), also come toxicity to normal HMEC-1 cells (HC50 53.75 uM).Structure: Helical in 50% TFE. Updated 7/2021",
