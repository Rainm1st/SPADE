    "Literature": "History and discovery: A frog used for \"hunting magic\" by several groups of Panoan-speaking Indians in the borderline between Brazil and Peru is identified as Phyllomedusa bicolor. This natural peptide, isolated from that frog skin,  may contain a D amino acid residue, since it is not identical in chromatographic properties to the synthetic peptide (Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Nov 15;89(22):10960-3). Synthetic adenoregulin enhanced the binding of agonists to several G-protein-coupled receptors in rat brain membranes.Sequence analysis: Alanine rich (33.3%).Activity: Active against M. canis IP 1194 (MIC 10 ug/ml), T. rubrum IP 1400-82 (MIC 15 ug/ml), A. fumigatus IP 1025-70 (MIC 125 ug/ml), A. simii IP 1063-74 (MIC 30 ug/ml), A. caviae IP 67-16 T (MIC 60 ug/ml), E. coli IP 76-24 (MIC 15 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa (MIC 3.1 uM), S. aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC 0.7 uM), N. brasiliensis IP 16-80 (MIC 30 ug/ml), C. neoformans IP 960-67 or IP 962-67 (MIC 15 ug/ml), and C. albicans (MIC 15 ug/ml).MOA:Cancer: linked to the regulation of the BAX/BBC3/AKT pathway (Nasirabadi and Doosti 2024).Structure: A helix-hinge-helix structural motif (helix 1: 1-8; helix 2: 11-31) was found in complex with SDS micelles. Of note is that the structure in TFE (helical 3-18) is quite different (Lequin et al., 2003). SDS-TFE-diff.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: E. coli BD21(DE3), pER32a vector, Trx fusion, Ni2+ affinity purification, enterokinase cleavage, HPLC purification, peptide yield: 1.67 mg/liter(?).SAR: recombinant study: amidated form is more potent (Cao et al., 2005.APD Updated 10/2008; 5/2014; 7/2017; 7/2021; 12/2024 GW",
