    "Literature": "Strongly active against S. aureus or MRSA (MIC 5-7 uM), S. epidermidis (MIC 3 uM), S. saprophyticus (MIC 13 uM), Streptococcus group C (MIC 3 uM), S. sonnei (MIC 35 uM), E. coli (MIC 6 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 60 uM), E. cloacae (MIC 35 uM), C. albicans (MIC 40-56 uM).Toxicity: Moderate hemolytic HC50 = 70 uM. The change of G4 to K4 led to a peptide with improved TI (Chem Biol Drug Des 2008; 72: 58-64). Solution structures of the WT (helical residues 3-17) and the mutant (helical 6-17) were determined in TFE. In addition, XT-7 adopted a similar conformation in DHPC (dihexanoylphosphatidylcoline) (Subasinghage AP et al.). Updated 4/1/13; 2/2019; 5/2020.",
