    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD calculated molecular weight:  3308.823; molecular formula: C136H221N41O44S5; Wimley-White whole-residue hydrophobicity: 4.58 kcal/mol;  molar extinction coefficient: 3292.5 (Cys paired) and 2980 (Cys not paired). Most similar to snakin-2 (39% similarity in sequence).Activity: Lehrer's radial diffusion assay: Active against P. azadirachtae PTCC5027 (MIC 7.65 ug/mL), S. aureus PTCC1442 (MIC 28.8 ug/ml), E. coli PTCC2433 (MIC 13.6 ug/ml), K. pneumoniae PTCC4231 (MIC 14.1 ug/ml), B. subtilis (MIC 24.2 ug/ml), A. niger (MIC 9.3 ug/ml), C. albicans PTCC4236 (MIC 8.23 ug/ml), and P. ultimum PTCC5021 (MIC 8.36 ug/ml).Snakin-Z also displayed antioxidant activity and is an enzyme inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) enzymesToxicity: peptide/human RBC incubation 30 min: not hemo.lytic at 100 ug/ml.Structure: the 3D structure has been predicted to have a helical fold. There are two possible disulfide bonds (C6-C32 and C11-C25) in the predicted structure according to Teker.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: the peptide has been heterologously expressed as a 30.14 kDa GST fusion protein after induction with 0.1 mM IPTG at 32oC. After afficity chromatographic purification and dialysis, the yield is 6.5 mg/L. The GST-fusion peptide is active against S. aureus ATCC 25923 (IC50 12.07 uM) (Teker et al., 2023).Updated 8/2013; peptide expression provided by Tugba Teker. 10/2023.",
