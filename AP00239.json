    "Literature": "History: The peptide was initially discovered by Gibson BW, Poulter L, Williams DH, Maggio JE. in 1986 Novel peptide fragments originating from PGLa and the caerulein and xenopsin precursors from Xenopus laevis. J Biol Chem. 1986 Apr 25;261(12):5341-9.  Its antimicrobial activity was demonstrated in 1988 (see the ref).Activity: Activity against E. coli (25922), S. pyogenes (19615) (MIC 10-50ug/ml) and P. aeruginosa (27883 (MIC 50-100ug/ml).  Also active against  protozoan P. caudatum (minimal disruptive conc MDC 10 ug/ml), A. castellani (MDC 2 ug/ml), and T. pyriformis (MDC 20 ug/ml).Toxicity:  little hemo.lytic (6%) till 1000 ug/ml (cf. mellitin showed 100% lysis at 50 ug/ml).
