  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (52.94%) tofrog Temporin-LT1Activity: Active against S. aureus NCTC 10788 64 uM), MRSA NCTC 12493 (MIC 64 uM), E. faecalis NCTC 12697 (MIC 64 uM), E.coli NCTC 10418 (MIC 128 uM), C.albicans NCTC 10231 (MIC >128 uM), K.pneumoniae ATCC 43816 (MIC >128 uM), P.aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC >128 uM). Mainly active against Gram-positive pathogens. It showed minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC) at 128 uM against S. aureus NCTC 10788Toxicity:  poorly hemo.lytic to 4% horse RBC (256 uM less than 10%) after 2 h incubation.Structure:  C-terminal amidated (XXA). Helical in 50% TFE.SAR:  A change of residues 8 and 9 (QE) to a GK motif produced the best antibacterial peptide with increased activity against most of the above bacteria. Antibiofilm activity increased to MBIC 4 uM.",
