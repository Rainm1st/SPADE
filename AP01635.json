    "Literature": "Activity: Active against E. coli (MIC 70 uM) and B. subtilis (MIC 15.5 uM). Also active against S. aureus (more potent than against B. subtilis) and P. aeruginosa (MIC 50-150 uM).Structure:  The peptide adopts a helical conformation in 30% TFE or higher concentrations of SDS.In vitro toxicity: Hemolytic HC50=45 uM. The peptide exhibits mast cell degranulation activity comparable to mastoparan.  Also, human RBC: HC50 48.5 uM; rat RBC: HC50 55.6 uM (Ye et al., 2023).Updated 10/30/2010; jAN2017; 7/2021; 7/2024",
