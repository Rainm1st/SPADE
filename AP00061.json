It also has anti-HIV (EC50 21.4 ug/ml), and spermicidal effects.In vitro toxicity: toxic to cell IC50 24.2 ug/ml, similar to EC50 against HIV-1(Lai R et al., 2012).Structure:  A helix-break-helix structure was found in SDS micelles or methanol.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure in SDS micellesherein the PDB. The N-terminus is highly disordered. Despite the similarities in the overall topology of the two structures, major differences were observed in terms of the interactions stabilizing the kink region and the arrangement of the four lysine residues. This has a marked influence on the shape and charge distribution of the molecule and may have implications for the bacterial selectivity of the peptide(Toke O et al. 2011 Eur Biophys J).
