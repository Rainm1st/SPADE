    "Literature": "Activity: Active against B. subtilis (MIC 0.8 uM), S. aureus MRSA (MIC 6.8-25 uM), E. coli (MIC 2-25 uM), and P. aeruginosa (MIC 18.5 uM). The peptide also exhibits mast cell degranulating activity.  Also, the peptide was found to inhibit Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 HIV-1 (EC50 4.34 uM), TC50 7.75 uM in CEM-SS (Wang G et al. 2010 Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 54: 1343-1346).Toxicity:  rat RBC hemolysis HC50 >100.Structure:  helical in 40% TFE or 0.16 or 16 mM SDS.SAR:  Using synthetic peptides, Pro11 was found to be important for peptide selectivity. Changes of Pro11 to Ala, Lys, and Gly or delection of Pro11 had little effect on antibacterial activities but increased the hemolytic activities.  The antibacterial region is located at the N-terminus of the peptide (a peptide containing residues 1-10 is active).   Updated 7/2021",
