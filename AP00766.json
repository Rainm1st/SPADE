  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "A= 31%. Circularized by forming a peptide bond between the N- and C-ends. The linear form is less active. It causes K+ ion efflux from indicator cells and liposome. Initially, it was thought to differ from Reutericin 6 only by the number of D-amino acids (Kawai et al., 2004). A re-study corrected this and concluded that gassericin A and reutericin 6 are identical bacteriocins (Arakawa et al. 2010 Lett Appl. Microbiol 50:406-411). However, reutericin 6 was isolated from Lactobacillus reuteri LA6(Kabuki T et al., 1997). Found in multiple species.  Updated 3/2010; 1/7/11; 10/2012 GW.",
