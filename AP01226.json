  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Inhibition zone assay (1.5 nmol in sterile saline): Active against E. coli 6 sensitive strains, K. pneumoniae, K.oxytoca, S. typhi 2 sensitive strains, S. typhimurium, Salmonella sp. 4 strain,  S. flexneri, Shigella sp., S.marcescens, P. mirabilis, P.vulgaris, E.herbicola, P.aeruginosa, P.maltophilia, S.aureus, S.epidermidis, B.amyloliquefaciens, M.luteus, S.agalactiae, C.albicans, R.mucilaginosa.  Bacteriostatic! Also inhibits P. gingivalis (Lie et al., 2024).Chemical modification:  The ribosomally synthesized peptide is called MccA, which is posttranslationaly modified at the C-terminus by adenosine monophosphate, leading to the mature peptide MccC7 (also N-terminally formylated).MOA:bacteria:E. coli: MccC7 is recognizied by bacterial transporters, including E. coli YejABEF, and smuggled into the target bacteria in a \"Trojan horse\" trick. Within the bacteria, MccC7 is cleaved after residue 6 into Asp-NH-AMP. The derived toxic adenosine monophosphate compd targets the aspartyl-tRNA synthetase and inhibits protein synthesis (JACS 2008; 130: 3603-3609).Go to PubChemfor additional information Jan2019.Updated 12/2024",
