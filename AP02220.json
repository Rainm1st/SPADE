  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "A variant of Subtilosin A, where residue T6 in Subtilosin A has been mutated to isoleucine. This change led to increased antimicrobal activity and hemolysis.  Active against Like B. subtilis (MIC 100 uM), B.anthracis (MIC 256 uM), B. cereus, B. thuringiensis (MIC 64 uM), E. faecalis, S. carnosus (MIC 16 uM), L. monocytogenes, S. pyogenes (MIC 64 uM). Hemolytic: rabbit blood 16 uM. Subtilosin A, it is an N- and C-circulated peptide with three rare cross-links between the sulfurs of Cys13, Cys7, and Cys 4 and the alpha-carbons of Phe22, Thr28, and Phe31, respectively.  Active against B. anthracis, B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, E. faecalis, S. carnosus, L. monocytogenes, and S. pyogenes (MIC 3-16 uM).  Subtilosin A1 is more active against bacteria and blood cells than subtilosin A (WT). updated 7/2021",
