  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Active against S. aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC 16 ug/ml), E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 16 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa PAO1 (MIC 16 ug/ml), and S. enterica serovar Typhi (MIC 8 ug/ml). Antibiofilm of P. gingivalis and inhibited virulence factor genes.Toxicity: hRBC: HC50> 1280 ug/ml (poor hemo.lytic). Likewise, it caused ~10% cell death at 20 ug/ml of HEK 293 and human epithelial fibroblasts (HEF) (to all the cells, there was an increased toxicity at high peptide concentrations).Chemotactic: DP7 recruited neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages to the site of infection. The adjuvant (DP7 + CpG oligonucleotide) induces chemokine/cytokine expression, enhances the antigen uptake by dendritic cells and upregulated surface marker expression in dendritic cells (Tian et al., 2021).The original has been merged with AP1030. 7/2021",
