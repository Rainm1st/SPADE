  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: weakly active against E.coli (MIC 150 ug/ml) (PubMed1997). Active against S. aureus NCTC 10788 or MRSA (MIC 2-4 uM), E. coli ATCC 8739 (MIC 32 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC 43816 (MIC 64 uM), E. faecium NTCC 12697 (MIC 16 uM), and P.aeruginosa ATCC 9027 (MIC 128 uM). It also showed antiproliferative activity to t H838 (IC50 27.71 uM), PC-3 (IC50 32.13 uM), HCT-116 (IC50 8.539 uM), MCF-7 (IC50 26.49 uM), and U251MG (IC50 20.13 uM) cancer cell lines (Yao et al., 2023).  It causes a release of histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells.Structure: This peptide forms an amphipathic helix in a membrane-mimetic TFE (50%) with residues 3-11 being helical (Aschi M et al., 2017), providing a basis for its activity.Toxicity: it is highly hemolytic (40% hemolysis at 25 ug/ml). Toxic to HaCaT (IC50 31.23 uM), LDH release reached 20% above 25 uM.Animal model:wax moth: Treatment with this peptide at a single dose at 25 or 50 mg/kg 1 h after K. pneumoniae infection protected Galleria mellonella from infection-caused deaths.
