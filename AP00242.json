    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: A natural variant of caerin 1.1. with K11 substituted by Q.Activity: Activity against B. cereus (MIC 50 ug/ml), E. coli (MIC 100 ug/ml), L. lactis (MIC 25 ug/ml), L. innocua (MIC 100 ug/ml), M. luteus (MIC 1.5 ug/ml), P. multocida (MIC 25 ug/ml), S. aureus (MIC 100 ug/ml), S. epidermidis (MIC 100 ug/ml), and S. uberis (MIC 100 ug/ml). By similarity to Caerin 1.1, it contains two amphipathic helices separated by a region of less-defined helicity and greater flexibility. This peptide could inhibit HIV infection (VanCompernolle et al., 2015).Updated 6/2015. 4/2019 CW; 12/2024 GW.",
