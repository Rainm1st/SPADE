    "Literature": "Discovery: homologous cecropin screening of the representative transcriptomes from the 1000 Insect Transcriptome Evolution (1KITE) dataset based on known cecropins from the APD and NCBI.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (59.52%) toPvul-cecropinpI: 11.6; GRAVY: -0.386; Mol Wt: 3872.673; Mol formula: C176H297N54O42S1; Mol Ex coeff:  5550.Activity: active against Gram- E. coli ATCC25922 (MIC 8 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa CGMCC 1.10712 (MIC 32 ug/ml), but not Gram+ M.luteus ATCC9341 (MIC >128 uM) and S.aureus ATCC6538 (MIC > 128 ug/ml). Activity against E. coli also observed in zone inhibition (20 ug peptide).Toxicity: sheep RBC (4%): 1.72% hemolysis at 50 ug/ml.Structure: helical in SDS or 50% TFE.
