  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Active against E. coli (MIC 14.5 uM), S. aureus (MIC 28 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 28 uM), and E. fecalis (MIC 14.5 uM). The sequence of chain B is ENREVPPGFTALIKTLRKCII. Distinctin, monomeric, and homodimeric forms showed similar antibacterial activities. The S-S bond is important to stabilize the helix-bundle structure in water.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. This structure, however, does not occur in lipid bilayers, as both helices sit on the membrane (Resende JM et al. 2009 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 106(39):16639-44). Animal model:mouse: The peptide is effective in a systemic neutropenic murine model (i.p. infected with S. aureus), in particular when intravenously treated in combination with traditional antibiotics (Cirioni O et al. 2008 Crit Care Med 36, 2629-33).
