  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "The amino acid analysis of the molecule was initially reported in 1979 (Kato T et al., 1979). A fully sequence and activity characterization was achieved recently (see the ref). APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE shows 84.6% similarity toTridecaptin A1.  Active against multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacteria.",
