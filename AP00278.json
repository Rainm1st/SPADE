    "Literature": "Active against E. coli  ML-35p,  L. monocytogenes  EGD  and  C. albicans  in  radial  diffusion  assays (dose dependent, see Fig. 6 in the ref). More active than Clavanin A or B (see ref). A recent study revealed increased antimicrobial activity in the presence of Zn2+ but not Cu2+: Clavanin C is active against E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 16 ug/ml), E. faecalis ATCC 29212 (MIC 64 ug/ml), S. aureus ATCC 43300 MRSA (MIC 16 ug/ml), and C. albicans ATCC 10231 (MIC 16 ug/ml) in the presence of Zn2+ (Miller et al., 2021) (Provided by Adriana Miller).
