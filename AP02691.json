    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE most resembles (41.7% similarity)Holothuroidin 1.Activity: Active against Gram-negative V. cholerae and Gram-positive B. pumilus (MIC 61.2 uM).Toxicity: At the MIC, it caused 3.3% hemolysis of human red blood cells (hRBCs). Weak anticancer activity (IC50s are 126 uM to HeLa cells and 168 uM to CaSki cells). Doesn't appear to be toxic. Updated 7/2021",
