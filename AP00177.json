  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Activity against E. coli CIP 76.24, P. aeruginosa CIP 76.110 (MIC 1ug/ml), Y. enterocolitica CIP 80.27, S. aureus ATCC 29213 and S. epidermidis CIP 68.21 (MIC 0.5ug/ml). Human HNP-1 blocks papillomavirus infection (both cutaneous and mucosal papillomavirus types).Host expression:HNPs 1-3 and HD-5 have been reported to be present in the female genital tract at levels that overlap those that inhibit HPVs in vitro (Buck et al., 2006). HNP-2 is active against HSV-1, HSV-2, pseudotyped viruses expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins (Xu et al., 2021).Structure: S-S bond pattern: Cys1–Cys6, Cys2–Cys4, and Cys3–Cys5. Crystal structures for several HNP2 mutants are available in the PDB. The PDB link below shows the structure with a G16 to D-Ala mutation.You can rotate, zoom, and view the dimeric crystal structureherein the PDB.MOA:virus:HIV:  It is a lectin and binds to gp120 and CD4, thereby preventing HIV entry (Wang et al. 2004 J Immunol 173: 515-20). Enzyme inhibitor: it inhibits protein kinase C (Charp et al., 1988).animal model:anti-toxin:mouse:  HNP-1-3 protected mice against the fatal consequences of B. anthracis produces lethal toxin (LeTx).Updated 2/2014; 11/2018; 8/2021; Jan2023",
