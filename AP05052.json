  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is 80% similar tosynthetic HPA3NT3K: 47%, L=A=W: 13%.Activity: active against E. coli (MIC 4 uM) and S. aureus (MIC 32 uM) in MHB.Antimicrobial robustness: the peptide become more active under non-standard conditions such as 10% MHB or PBS. Active against multiple bacteria (e.g., P. aeruginosa, S. typhimurium). NaCl-sensitive:E. coli (100-200 mM) in PBS, MgCl2-sensitive:E. coli (6 mM) in MHB; NaCl-sensitive:S. aureus (100-200 mM) in PBS, MgCl2-sensitive:S. aureus (6 mM) in MHB.Resistance development:no:bacteriaS. aureus: no resistance to HPA3NT3-A2D after 12 passages.Structure: random coil in buffer and helical in TFE (30%).Half-life in vitro:serum:human: degradation was observed after 60 min incubation in 50% serum.SAR: In contrast, no sign of degradation was observed when D-lysine was used (i.e., peptide HPA3NT3-A2D). The A2D peptide retained activity in serum (?).In vitro toxicity: sheep RBC: not hemo.lytic till 250 uM. Showed low toxicity to HaCaT above 50 uM (10% cell death at 250 uM),",
