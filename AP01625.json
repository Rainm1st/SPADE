    "Literature": "First described by Quellette and Lualdi 1990 J Biol Chem 265:9831-7). CRS peptides do not have the same antimicrobial spectrum. Together, they provide a more effective protecting barrier to pathogen invasion. Redox systems appear to participate in the regulation of the activity of this family of peptides (refer to hBD-1).",
