    "Literature": "host protease cleavage:  Protease-cleaved product of LL-37 in human sweat very likely via tryptic  and  chymotryptic  serine  proteases. The active fragment appeared to be short-lived in vitro since it reduced with time and became not detectable after 24 h.Activity: Active against C. albicans and susceptible strain S. aureus mprF (KO).Structure:  Structure is predicted to be helical based on NMR studies of intact LL-37 and its fragments in micelles.",
