    "Literature": "Discovery: a fragment from HIV-1 virus.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (50%) toL5K5W.  R: 50%; K: 17%.Activity: active against MRSA demonstrated in human HeLa cells in vitro. D-form is more effective due to resistance to proteases (D>L). A similar sequence TAT(48-57) (seq: GRKKRRQRRR) inhibits HIV-1 (Keogan et al., 2012).",
