  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (94.1%) toBrevinin-2GHa. It differs from Brevinin-2GHa at position 16 (S to Q) and an extra C-terminal Alanine in the case of Brevinin-2GHa.Activity: Weakly active against S. aureus (MIC 64 uM) and E. faecalis (MIC 64 uM). Inactive: MRSA, E.coli (MIC>512 uM), P.aeruginosa (MIC>512 uM), K.pneumoniae (MIC >512 uM) and C.albicans (MIC >256 uM).MOA:bacteria: These peptides can permeate membranes. This peptide also inhibit Zika virus (ZIKV) in the early and middle stages of infection.MOA:virus:  BR2GK blocked ZIKV E protein expression with an IC50 of 3.408 uM (Xiong et al., 2021).Structure:  The peptide is random coiled in water and folded into a helical conforamtion in the presence of LPS, 25% TFE, or SDS.Toxicity:  HMEC-1 cells IC50 100 uM. Less hemo.lytic: HC50 256 uM.SAR:  C-terminally truncated peptides (amidated), especially residues 1-25,  became more and broadly active against Gram+, Gram-, and fungi (see AP3170).
