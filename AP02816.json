  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide shows 49% similarity tolacticin Q. N-terminal Met is formylated. leaderless.Activity:Active against S. saprophyticus (MIC 82.3-160 nM), S. hominis (MIC 160 nM), S. warneri (MIC 160 nM), E. faecalis (MIC 160 nM), including multidrug-resistant S. epidermidis strains causing biofilm-related infections (MIC 10-658 nM), S. aureus 1195 MRSA (MIC 160-329 nM), and vancomycin-resistant enterococci anti-VRE (MIC 82.3-329 nM).Antimicrobial robustness: lysozyme, lipase, and alpha-amylase treatment did not cause activity loss, but proteinase k and trypsin caused 25-50% acitivity loss. pH-insensitive (pH 2-10). heat-stable aftwe 70oC treatment for 60 min.Structure: It contains four helices: I: 2-13; II: 15-25; III: 25-36; and IV: 38-51.You can rotate, zoom, and view the lipid II bound 3D structureherein the PDB.MOA:bacteria: it acts on bacterial membranes by forming pores (Hammond et al., 2020).Recombinant production:bacteria: It can be expressed in Escherichia coil BL21(DE3). The recombinant peptide shows activity against M. luteus and S. aureus strains in lawn assays.Toxicity: not hemo.lytic at 100 x MIC. At this concentration, not toxic to human dermal\nfibroblast cell linesAnimal model:wax moth: Galleria mellonella larvae were infected with 2.5 Ã— 10(6) cells per larva, the survival was improved when treated with vancomycin (50 mg/kg) or synthetic epidermicin (200 mg/kg) 2 h post infection. Better effects were observed when treated at 30 min post-infection.Animal model:rat: A single dose of epidermicin NI01 is sufficient to eradicate MRSA ATCC 43300 from the nares of cotton rats: Epidermicin NI01 administered once at 0.8% showed excellent efficacy, resulting in a log R of 2.10 cfu/nares ( P = 0.0004), which was equivalent to mupirocin (2.59 CFU/nares). However, treated twice at 0.4% or 0.04% was ineffective (Halliwell et al., 2017). UPdated 5/2023",
