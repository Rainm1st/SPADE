  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (85.7%) toinsect Hyphancin IIIF.Discovery: In the ref, two forms of cecropins A (A1 and A2) were isolated and sequenced. They share the same 35-residue sequence with no activity data reported. This peptide is now registered into the APD due to new activity data.Activity: A recombinant form was found to be active against B. subtilis and L. monocytogenes (Lee et a;., 2013).SAR: A different form of cecropin A with 37 amino acids (two additional C-terminal residues GK+amidation) was synthesized for antifungal and anticancer studies. It is named as B. mori cecropin A (BmCecA). Active against entomopathogenic fungus B. bassiana BbHN6, both in vitro and in vivo in the silkworm larvae (Lu et al., 2016).MOA:cancer: It also has an anticancer effect through the promotion of tumor cell apoptosis (Xu et al., 2020).
