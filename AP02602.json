  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "It seems that P. aeruginosa can release the C-terminal fragment once cultivation with stratum corneum, thereby contributing to human skin defense.  APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide shows poor similarity (33.8%) toCod cathelicidin.  Active against E. coli ATCC 11775 (MIC 13 uM) and P. aeruginosa ATCC 33354 (MIC 3.3 uM), and multiple clinical strains of P. aeruginosa. It can also bind DNA in vitro.",
