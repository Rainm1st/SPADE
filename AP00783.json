    "Literature": "Chemical modification: C-terminal NH2.Activity: Active against A. salmonicida 99-1 (MIC 4 uM), A. salmonicida 97-4 (MIC 2 uM), S. enterica serovar Typhimurium MS7953s (MIC 2 uM), S. enterica serovar Typhimurium 14028s (MIC 8 uM), P. aeruginosa K799 (MIC 4 uM), P. aeruginosa Z61 (MIC 2 uM), E. coli CGSC4908 or UB1005 or DC2 (MIC 4 uM), S. epidermidis C621 or MRSA (MIC 64 uM), and C. albicans C627 (MIC 16 uM).Peptide formulation: when encapsulated in chitosan nanoparticles, it decreased the bacterial and cancer cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner. Activities of encapsulated peptide were >2-fold higher than those of free NRC-07 peptide.  Updated 7/2021; 10/2023",
