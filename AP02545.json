    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide shows poor similarity (33.8%)  toGalleria defensin. Moderately active against B. subtilis; M. luteus; E. faecalis; P. aeruginosa; Y. enterocolitica; and A. calcoaceticus (MIC 22-77 uM). It likely targets at bacterial sodium channels. Little hemolysis at 90 and 180 uM.  Provided by Xiuqing Wang.",
