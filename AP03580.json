    "Literature": "Warning: the amino acid sequence has been extensively modified. Structure is Methyldecanoyl-MePro-AHMOD-Ala-Aib-Ile-Iva-bAla-Alaol-Glyol (see below).Chemical modification: P1 is methylated, residue 2 is represented by Q but it is 2-Amino-4-methyl-6-hydroxy-8-oxo decanoic acid (AHMOD), residue 4 is a methylated Ala (Aib), residue 6 is isovaline, residue 7 is beta-alanine, residue 8 is alaninol, and residue 9 is ethanolamine.Activity: active against E.coli MG1655 (MIC >300 ug/ml), S.enterica ATCC 14028 (MIC >300 ug/ml), P.aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC >300 ug/ml), B. cereus ATCC 14893 (MIC 16 ug/ml), S. aureus FDA 209 P (MIC 4 ug/ml), and L. monocytogenes EGDe (MIC 32.5 ug/ml). Also, active against 4 strains S. aureus (MBC 12.5-25 ug/ml), 5 strains E. faecium (MBC 25-50 ug/ml), A. baumannii (MBC 25-50 ug/ml), K. pneumoniae (MBC 25 ug/ml). Inhibited biofilm formation of S. aureus and E. faecalis at 0.5 MBC.Antifungal activity: Disc-diffusion Assay: active against fungi: A. niger ATCC 16404 (25 mm), A. niger 1133 m (18 mm), A. fumigatus VKM F-37 (20 mm), A. fumigatus 390 m (20 mm), A. terreus 3 K (12 mm), and A. terreus 497 (14 mm). Microdilution assays: The MIC values for EmiA were in the 0.5â€“4 ug/mL range: A. niger ATCC 16404 (MIC 4 ug/ml), A. niger 1133 m or 219 (MIC 4 ug/ml), A. terreus 3 K (MIC 0.5 ug/ml), A. terreus 497 (MIC 1 ug/ml), A. fumigatus VKM F-37 or 163 (MIC 2 ug/ml), A. flavus 905 (MIC 4 ug/ml), and A. fumigatus 390 m (MIC 2 ug/ml). Since EmiA is more active, its activity was tested using additional multidrug-resistant fungal strains: C. albicans 1402 or 1582 or ATCC14053 (MIC 2 ug/ml), C. glabrata 1402 (MIC 0.25 ug/ml), C. krusei 1447 (MIC 0.5 ug/ml), C. tropicalis 156 or 1402 (MIC 1-2 ug/ml), C. parapsilosis 571 (MIC 1 ug/ml), C. neoformans 297 (MIC 0.5 ug/ml), and C. laurentii 325m (MIC 0.5 ug/ml).Anticancer activity: EmiA also has cytotoxic properties towards a wide range of tumor cell lines of various origins: HCT-116 (IC50 2.3 uM), MCF-7 (IC50 11 uM), HPF (IC50 11.5 uM), K-562 (IC50 1 uM), B16 (IC50 16 uM), MDA-MB-231 (IC50 8 uM).Toxicity: 12.6% hemolysis of hRBC at 20 ug/ml (cf.: 100% lysis by gramicidin S).",
