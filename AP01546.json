  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Active against E. coli ML35p, E. coli 363 ATCC 11775 (MIC 5 uM), and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853(MIC 40 uM). This peptide was unstructured in water but became helical upon binding to anionic lipids but not zwitterionic lipids. It showed selective activity against gram-negative bacteria and not toxic to fresh rat erythrocytes. DRS-DA4 showed strong chemoattraction to human leukocytes. Updated 9/2014; 7/2018.",
