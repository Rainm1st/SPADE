    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (45.83%) toRTD-2R: 33%; W=C=G: 10%; GRAVY: -1.77; M Wt: 2803.283; Mol formula: C120H194N48O27S2; mol ex coeff: 12715.Activity:  Gram- X. campestris pv. Holcicola (MIC 4.25 uM), X. oryzae pv. oryzicola (MIC 17 uM), X. oryzae pv. oryzae (MIC 17 uM), and X. oryzae pv. oryzae (MIC 8.5 uM). They can cause a serious blight of rice.Antimicrobial robustness:  The peptide retains antibacterial activity after 2 hours of UV treatment and exposure to high temperatures up to 100Â°C. NaCl-insensitive:X. campestris (250 mM), NaCl-insensitive:X. oryzae (250 mM), KCl-insensitive:X. campestris (250 mM), KCl-insensitive:X. oryzae (250 mM), MgCl2-insensitive: X. campestris (62.5 mM), MgCl2-insensitive:X. oryzae (62.5 mM), CaCl2-sensitive: X. campestris (31.25 mM), CaCl2-sensitive:X. oryzae (31.25 mM).Toxicity: sheep RBC: 4xMIC peptide (3.26% hemolysis).Plant protection:rice: after 21 days treatment, the peptide partly inhibited the expansion of rice bacterial blight.",
