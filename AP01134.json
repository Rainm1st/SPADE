  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "75% similar to the parent peptide plicatamide (AP01357). Obtained via sequence shuffling.Activity: active against S. mutans (MIC 8 ug/ml), S. sanguinis (MIC 16 ug/ml), MRSA (MIC 32 ug/ml), E. faecalis (MIC 16 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa (MIC 16 ug/ml), and E. coli (MIC 8 ug/ml).Peptide conjugate:  the peptide is linked to a S. mutans targeting sequence via a linker (to generate a STAMP). Different linkers were tested. In all the designs, the activity of PL-135 was found to reduce by 2-8 fold against S. mutans.The original has been merged with AP1109. Updated 7/2021; 2/2024",
