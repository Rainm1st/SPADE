  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide most resembles (47.5% similarity)Cecropin C. Potently active against Gram- E. coli ATCC 25922, including clinical strains, P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027, S. typhimurium ATCC 14028, A. baumannii ATCC 17978 (MIC 0.87-2.33 uM), and Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 6538, B. subtilis ATCC 6633, and M. luteus ATCC 4698 (MIC 14.5-43.7 uM).  The peptide is induced in the salivary glands after treatment with E. coli. Like other cecropins, it is helical (0.2 mg/ml) in the presence of SDS (5-40 mM) or LPS (400 ng/ml), very likely membrane targeting. In addtion, SibaCec substantially inhibited NO, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6. It appears that SibaCec exerts its anti-inflammatory effect through inhibition of MAPKs and NF-kB inflammatory signaling pathways.",
