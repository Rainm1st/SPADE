    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (50%) toAamAP1. I: 30%;Activity:  moderately to weakly active against S. aureus (MIC 16-32 uM), MRSA (MIC 32-64 uM), E.faecalis (MIC 128 uM), E.coli (MIC>512 uM), P.aeruginosa (>512 uM), and C. albicans (MIC 64-128 uM). Cf. melittin (MIC 1-8 uM, mostly). The peptide displayed dose-dependent anticancer effects on cell lines.Toxicity:  no detectable hemolysis till 160 uM (not hemo.lytic).Structure:  Random in water and helical in TFE (50%).Updated 7/2021; 12/2024",
