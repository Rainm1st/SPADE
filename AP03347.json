    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (96.67%) toBrevinin-2GHbIt only differs from Brevinin-2GHb at position 20: K in the current peptide and R in Brevinin-2GHb.Structure:  Helical in SDS micelles (CD). This helical structure persists in the presnece of salts or at high temperature.Activity:  Weakly active against Gram+ and Gram- bacteria and fungi. This peptide can also brevinin- 2KP can promote degranulation and histamine release from mast cells. To be updated.",
