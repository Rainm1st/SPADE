  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (95%) tofungal PlectasinA natural variant of plectasin. Py4 differs from plectasin only at two positions: Q14K and G33A. GRAVY: -0.65; Mol Wt: 4422.082; Mol formula: C191H282N51O55S7; molar ex. coeff.: 10395.Activity:  inhibition-zone assay: active against Gram+ B. megaterium CGMCC 1.0459 (lethal conc CL 0.67 uM), C. luteum (LC 0.03 uM), S. aureus CGMCC 1.89 (LC 1.22 uM), Penicillin-sensitive S. epidermidis P1111 (LC 4.03 uM), Penicillin-resistant S. epidermidis P1111 (LC 4.38 uM),  Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) P1374 (LC 2.69 uM),  Methicillin-resistant coagulase negative Staphylococci P1369 (CL 4.78 uM), MRSA P1386 (CL 2.51 uM), S. aureus J685,  S. aureus J698 (CL 2.69 uM),  S. aureus J706 (CL 2.51 uM), and S. warneri CGMCC 1.2824 (CL 1.06 uM). Usually, LC is comparable to MIC.Serum effect: activity remained in the presence of mouse serum (% unknown).MOA: Py4 inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis.Structure:  homologous modeling as an alphabeta fold. CD spectra appeared to be a combined alpha and beta structure.Toxicity: Py4 showed no hemolysis from 3.1 to 25 uM.",
