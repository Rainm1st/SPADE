    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (97.14%) toCryptdin-3.Activity: active against E. coli. ALso killed S. aureus based on virtual colony count assays (2.3 ug/ml killed 50%; 9.8 ug/ml killed 99.9%). This method exposed bacteria to peptides for 2 h in 10 mM phospahtate buffer before incubating in media for 12 h (Wang et al., 2023).The original was merged with AP479. Updated 7/2021; 2/2023",
