    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (57.69%) toPR-39(1–26)R: 40%, P: 47%.Activity: active against E. coli (MBC 5 uM) and B. globigii (MBC 5 uM).Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-sensitive:E. coli (100 mM); NaCl-sensitive:B. globigii (100 mM).SAR: further delection of the C-terminal sequence made peptide activity susceptible to NaCl at 100 mM.",
