    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (97.3%) toPMAP-37 F9RActivity: Active against Gram+ S. aureusATCC25923 (MIC 0.049 ug/ml), S. epidermidis LY8 (MIC 25 ug/ml), L. monocytogenes CICC21533 (MIC 62.5 ug/ml), B. subtilis CICC24434 (MIC 0.78 ug/ml), Gram- S. choleraesuis C78-1 (MIC 0.78 ug/ml), S. typhimurium SL1344 (MIC 1.56 ug/ml), P. avium C48-3 (MIC 3.125 ug/ml), E. coli CICC10004 (MIC 12.5 ug/ml), and S. flexneri CICC21534 (MIC 75 ug/ml).Antimicrobial robustness: pH-sensitive especially above pH 12; activity reduced with boiling time to 120 min.SAR:  This double mutant showed identical activity as the single F9R mutant. The F34R variant has slightly higher activity among the three variants.Animal model:mouse: more animal survived with the peptide treatment for 3 days.",
