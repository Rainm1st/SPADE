    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: It contains a Pro-rich domain from residue 8 to 23. P: 16%.Activity: active against M. luteus (MIC 2.5-5 uM), E-coli 363 (MIC >40 uM), F. oxysporum (MIC 5-10 uM), S.cerevisiae TGY (MIC >100 uM). Warning: non-standard assays against bacteria in 1% bactotryptone.Recombinant production:yeast:Saccharomyces cerevisiae:  Additional antimicrobial assays were conducted using the recombinant  form: Gram+ bacteria A. viridans (MIC 1.25-2.5 uM),  B. megaterium (MIC 2.5-5 uM), E-faecalis (MIC >20 uM),  S-aureus (MIC>20 uM),  S-haemolyticus (MIC >40 uM),  Gram-  V-harveyi (MIC >40 uM), V-alginolyticus (MIC >40 uM), V-penaeicida (MIC >40 uM), V-vulnificus (MIC >20 uM), S-thyphimurium (MIC >20 uM), K-pneumoniae (MIC >20 uM), E-cloacae  (MIC >20 uM), E-carotovora (MIC >40 uM), Filamentous fungi N. haematococca (MIC 1.25-2.5 uM), N. crassa (MIC 2.5-5 uM), A. brassicola (MIC 2.5-5 uM), B. cinerea(MIC 5-10 uM), A-fumigatus (MIC>20 uM), and yeast C-albicans (MIC > 20 uM) (Destoumieux et al., 1999).  Recombinant pen-2 (rPen-2) showed selective killing of kidney cancer cell lines ACHN and A498 (Meng et al., 2014).SAR:  glycosylation (Man) reduced peptide activity against M. luteus and B. megaterium by four fold but had little effect on activity against fungi tested.Updated 12/2015; 12/2024.",
