    "Literature": "Discovery: The peptide was generated by cleaving a protein that delivers oxygen in the haemolymph of many chelicerate.  This is the first report of an arthropod hemocyanin fragment with activity against human viruses. Found in multiple species.Sequence analysis:  APD analysis reveals that the sequence  is 35.7% similar toHp1036. I: 30%; H: 20%.Activity: Active against fungi B. bassiana Trichosporon sp IOC4569 (MIC 1.1 uM), yeasts C. albicans MDM8 or IOC 4558 (MIC 8.37-16.75 uM), C. krusei IOC 4559 (MIC 16.75 uM), C. glabrata IOC 4565 (MIC MIC 8.37 uM),  C. parapsilosis IOC 4564 (MIC 16.75 uM), C. tropicalis IOC 4560 (MIC 8.75 uM), and C. guilliermondii IOC 4557 (MIC 16.75 uM). It binds yeast DNA but bit bacteria.  No antibacterial activity against M-luteus, S-aureus, S- epidermides, E-coli, P-aeruginosa found till 67 uM.This peptide also displayed antiviral effects on RNA viruses, measles, H1N1 and encephalomyocarditis (Katie C T Riciluca et al., 2021).Antimicrobial robustness: The antifungal activity of rondonin is pH-dependent and peaks at pH ~ 4â€“5 (pH-sensitive).Synergy:AMPs: showed synergy with gomesin against human yeast pathogens.In vitro toxicity: human RBC: not hemolyitc till 67 uM. not toxic till 200 uM to cervical cancer (HeLa) and mouse adrenal cancer (Y1) cells.Updated 7/2021; 6/2024",
