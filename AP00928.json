  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Structure:  An N- and C-circulated peptide. In addition, three rare cross-links were found between the sulfurs of Cys13, Cys7, and Cys 4 and the alpha-carbons of Phe22, Thr28, and Phe31, respectively (Kawulka KE et al. 2004. Biochemistry 43: 3385-3395). Such bridges are essential as disruption of these bonds led to an inactive circular peptide.  It has a boat-like (loop) structure with a recognized helix.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Activity:  Active against B. anthracis (MIC 16 uM), B. cereus, B. thuringiensis (MIC 40 uM), E. faecalis, S. carnosus (MIC 100 uM), L. monocytogenes (MIC 40 uM), and S. pyogenes (MIC 100 uM). Inactive: B.subtilis (MIC 250 uM). It also has spermicidal effect (Silkin L Bioorg Med Chem Lett. 2008 May 15;18(10):3103-6) as well as antiviral effect against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 (Torres NI et al., Probiotics Antimicrob Proteins. 2013 Mar 1;5(1):26-35; Quintata VM et al. 2014 J APPl Microbiol;  doi: 10.1111/jam.12618). Found in multiple species(Stein T et al, 2004;Sutyak KE et al, 2008).Toxicity:  Not hemo.lytic: rabbit blood agar >250 uM.Discovery: Also found in Bacillus tequilensis FR9 (Parvenn Rani et al., 2016).  A variant, called subtilosin A1, has also been identified and registered as a separate entry (see AP2220) (Huang T et al. 2009 J Bacteriol 191: 5690-6). Refer toAP2220.
