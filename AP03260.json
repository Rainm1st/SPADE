    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (85.7%) toTryglysin A.Chemical modification: The side chain of alpha and delta carbons of K6 are fused with the six membered ring of W4 (by forming two C-C bonds) into one additional six-membered aliphatic ring. The peptide Tryglysin was named after the tryptophan, glycine, and lysine amino acids that are involved in the macrocycle.Activity: Tryglysin B inhibited S. ferus DSM 20646 (++), S. mutans UA159 (++), S. sanguinis ATCC 10556 (++), S. gordonii Challis Bt (+), S. mitis CCUG 31611 (++), S. oralis 108 (++), S. pneumoniae D39 (++), S. agalactiae A909 (+), and S. bovis JB1 (+) (note: +, mildly inhibited; ++ inhibited).
