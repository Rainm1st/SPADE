    "Literature": "ActivityScreened pathogens, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium C610, E. coli D31, A. salmonicida A449, Y. ruckeri 96-4, and L. anguillarum 02-11 were found to be highly sensitive to myxinidin at the MBC of 1.0-2.5 ug/mL; S. epidermis C621 and yeast (C. albicans C627) had an MBC of 10.0 microg/mL. Also active against E. coli ATCC 11219 (MIC 5 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 13388 (MIC 30 uM), S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028 (MIC 20 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC 10031 (MIC 10 uM), S. aureus ATCC 6538 (MIC 10 uM). The antimicrobial activity of myxinidin was found to be two to 16 times more active than a potent fish-derived antimicrobial peptide, pleurocidin (NRC-17), against most of the screened pathogens. These results suggest that myxinidin may have potential applications in fish and human therapeutics.  Screened pathogens, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium C610, E. coli D31, A. salmonicida A449, Y. ruckeri 96-4, and L. anguillarum 02-11 were found to be highly sensitive to myxinidin at the MBC of 1.0-2.5 ug/mL; S. epidermis C621 and yeast (C. albicans C627) had an MBC of 10.0 microg/mL.Antimicrobial robustness:  (Salt-insensitive) The microbicidal activity of myxinidin was retained in the presence of sodium chloride (NaCl) at concentrations up to 0.3 M and had no hemolytic activity against mammalian red blood cells.3D structurehas been determined by NMR spectroscopy. In 50% TFE, the peptide has a helical structure (residues 2-8) with the C-terminal 4 residues GKPS disordered (Cantisani M et al., 2014). See critical residues.SAR:  Optimized antibacterial activity was obtained by adding a tryptophan residue at the N terminus and by the simultaneous substitution of residues present in positions 3, 4, and 11 with arginine (see AP. Updated 12/2014; 3/2017; 11/2017; Jan2024.",
