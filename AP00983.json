    "Literature": "70% similar toTPP3.Activity: Active against C. albicans (Anaya-López JL et al., 2006). It also inhibited the penetration of C. albicans into the infected cells.Immune modulation: this peptide showed immunomodulatory effects on bovine mammary epithelial cells to inhibit S. aureus internalization. It modulates the expression of multiple chemokines (Díaz-Murillo V et al., 2016).",
