  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Peptide design: obtained by replacing I20 and I24 of FK13 with W. In addition, D26 (as in LL-37) was substituted by R, leading to an Arg-rich peptide.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (76.92%) toFK-13.  R: 31%; W=F=K: 15%. GRAVY: -1.34; M Wt: 1906.311; M formula: C92H143N31O14, mol ex coeff: 0.Activity: Active against E. coli KCTC 1682 (MIC 4 uM), P. aeruginosa KCTC 1637 (MIC 16 uM), S. typhimurium KCTC 1926 (MIC 2 uM), Gram+ B. subtilis KCTC 3068 (MIC 2 uM), S. epidermidis KCTC 1917 (MIC 4 uM), and  S. aureus KCTC1621 (MIC 2 uM). Non-standard assay: activity was measured in 1% peptone where LL-37 (control) is active against S. aureus.Toxicity: human RBC: HC50 > 256 uM, not hemo.lytic.Structure: helical in 50% TFE.Anti-inflammatory: suppressed NO 42.1%, and TNF-alpha 17.4% (cf. LL-37: 100% and 90.4%, respectively).",
