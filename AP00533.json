  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Active against A. actinomycetemcomitans (MIC 24.84 uM), E.coli (MIC 397.45 uM), Stafilococcus.aureus (MIC 109.91 uM), and C. lusitaniae (MIC 50.25 uM) (GusmÃ£o KAG et al., 2017).SAR: N- or C-terminal truncation caused a loss of antimicrobial activity (>100 uM), indicating the requirement of the entire sequence for toxicity. SAR study using ala-scanning of 65 analogs was conducted and FA12 was found to be best candidate ( Protein Sci. 2007 Sep;16(9):1969-76).Structure: Structures were determined by NMR in DPC or SDS (Gomes et al., 2018).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.
