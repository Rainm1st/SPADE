    "Literature": "Also isolated by Korobov et al. 2010 Microbiology 79:206-215 and the reports by Russians on warnerin can be traced to 2005. APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE shows 80.6% similarity toEpilancin 15X. Based on this similarity, a structural model has been proposed (Polyudova et al. 2017 Applied Biochem Microbiol 53:40-46). In this model, there are three thioether bonds S11-C15, T19-C22, and T21-C24. In addition, S2, TT6, T7, and T27 are dehydrated (XXW4) into Dha for S and Dhb for T. The N-terminal chemical modification of the peptide is yet to be elucidated. Active against S. epidermis (MIC <1 ug/ml), S. epidermis ATCC 700566 (MIC 8 ug/ml),  S. epidermis ATCC 700567 (MIC 8 ug/ml), Staphylococcus sp. ATCC 700575 (MIC 32 ug/ml), S. aureus (VISA) CCUG 45315 (MIC 1.5 ug/ml), K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 (MIC 96 ug/ml), E. faecium ATCC 51559 (MIC 64 ug/ml), and E. faecium (anti-VRE) ATCC 700221 (MIC 32 ug/ml).
