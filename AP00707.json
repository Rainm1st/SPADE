    "Literature": "This dimeric peptide was designed to target both bacterial membranes and intracellular heat-shock protein (visit the PDB link). The N-terminus of the peptide contains 1-amino-cyclohexane carboxylic acid (Chex1). This chain then formed a dimer by covalently linking to 2,4-diamino-butyric acid.Activity: Active against Gram-negative bacteria. It also prevents B. anthracis mortality by deactivating bacterial toxins (Otvos et al., 2014).Structure:  It is of outstanding interest that A3-apo (residues 1-20) can bind in both the forward and reversed mode.You can rotate, zoom, and view the ball and stick structureherein the PDB.Peptide stability:  the peptide showed remarkable stability in 25% mouse serum (half-life 100 min) (Noto PB et al 2008 Protein Sci 17: 1249-55).Animal model::mouse: Of outstanding interest is that this peptide displayed systemic therapeutic effects in different mice models against E. coli, A. baumannii via mainly intramuscular administration, although intravenous treatment also showed some effect (see the ref). It is proposed that the dimer is decomposed in vivo into the active metabolite. Note that the monomer, Chex-Arg20, showed no membrane activity, while multimerization of chex-arg20 led to membrane-disruptive activity (Li W et al., 2015).  The original retro-FK13 entry was replaced. 8/18/2010;  Structure updated 9/13/2013; 12/2015; updated 7/2018.",
