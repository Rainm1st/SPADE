    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (87.8%) tofish gcLEAP-2There are two disulfide bonds: C17-C28, C23-C33. Mol. Wt: 4630.336; GRAVY: -0.556; Mol Formula:  C199H307N54O59S6; mol ex coeff: 10270.Gene expression: mainly in intestine and liver.Activity: Active against aquatic pathogens A. hydrophila AS1.1801 (MBC 32 uM), P-fluorescens AS1.55 (MBC >32 uM), E. tarda ATCC15947 (MBC 43 uM). The antioxidant capacity of GzLEAP-2A is much stronger than those of GzLEAP-2B and GzLEAP-2C.Toxicity: rabbit RBC, poor hemo.lytic (0.39%) at 200 ug/ml (HC50 >>200 ug/ml).",
