    "Literature": "Most similar (46.4%) tospider Acanthoscurrin 2AP02207.Activity: Active primarily against E. coli (MIC 2-5 uM) evaluated using a mixture of peptides. This is a bacteriostatic effect. The growth of S. aureus was inhibited (MIC >10 uM) and no inhibition was observed against C-albicans up to 5 uM.Host expression: constitutively expressed in hemocytes.   Provided by Xiuqing Wang.
