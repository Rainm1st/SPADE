    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (90.91%) toBP100L: 27%; K: 45%; F: 18%.  GRAVY: 0.18; M Wt: 1405.859; Mol formula:C72H124N16O12; molar extinction coeff: 0.Activity: active against Gram- E. coli (MIC 8 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa (MIC 16 ug/ml), Gram+ S. aeurus (MIC 62.3 ug/ml), fungi C. albicans (MIC 25 ug/ml), and F. solani (MIC 50 ug/ml). Also active against P. syringae pv. syringae (MIC 2.5-5 uM), X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria (MIC 2.5-5.0 uM), and E. amylovora (MIC 2.5-5.0 uM);Antimicrobial robustness:  NaCl-sensitive:E. coli (100-300 mM salt); MgCl2-sensitive:E. coli (5 mM salt); NaCl-sensitive:P. aeruginosa (100-300 mM salt); MgCl2-sensitive:P. aeruginosa (5 mM salt); NaCl-sensitive:C. albicans (100-300 mM salt); NaCl-insensitive:F. solani (100-300 mM salt); MgCl2-insensitive:F. solani (5 mM salt).Toxicity: HC50 400 ug/ml, little hemo.lytic (34% hemolysis at 150 uM).SAR: benzoylation (BP31) or benzylation (BP32) had very small effects on peptide activity. BP77 is acetylated form of BP76 with similar activity. BP78 is tosylated form of BP76 with similar activity.Plant protection:apple: Plant protection:pear: flowers pretreated at 100 and 200 uM of BP76 reduced the infection of plant pathogen E. amylovora. BP77 was less effective. Provided by Arjun Nair. Updated 3/2024",
