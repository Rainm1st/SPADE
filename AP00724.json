  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Active against drug resistant C. albicans clinical isolates (MIC 6.2-25 ug/ml) (Basso et al., 2018). In addition, the same peptide has also been characterized from leukocytes (Tran D et al. 2002 JBC 277:3079-84).  A minor form in blood leukocytes compared to RTD-1. It had similar antimicrobial activity as RTD-1 or RTD-3. MOA: It binds to gp120 and CD4, thereby inhibiting HIV entry (Wang W J Immunol 2004; 173:515-520). Sequence updated 8/9/2013; 5/2020.",
