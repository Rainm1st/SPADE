    "Literature": "47% similar to AP2719 (Chaxapeptin).Activity:  Active against Gram+ B. megaterium (3–6 uM), S. aureus (6–12 uM), L. monocytogenes (12–24 uM), E. faecalis (48–96 uM), Gram- E. coli (MIC 3–6 uM),  the marine bacteria V. harveyi (MIC 3–6 uM), V. aestuarianus (MIC 3–6 uM) and V. splendidus (MIC 3–6 uM), and human pathogenic gram-negative bacteria: S. thyphimurium (MIC 24-48 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 24-48 uM) and K. pneumoniae (MIC 24-48 uM).MOA:bacteriaIt can lyse bacterial cells (SEM). Further studies revealed that the peptide oligomerized in water. Partial folding occurs in DPC micelles. K4 is likely to work like a detergent (Legrand B et al. 2011. Biochim Biophys Acta 1808 (1), 106-16).Structure:  In the presence of SDS micelles, K4 is helical.Toxicity:  hemolysis <3% at 10, or 40 ug/ml and 6.65% at 160 ug/ml (96 uM). poorly hemo.lytic. Started to show toxicity to Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) at a high concentration 160 ug/ml and killed 90% cells at 640 ug/ml (384 uM).Entry history: The original peptide has been replaced.Updated Jan2020; 8/2022",
