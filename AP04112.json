  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (87.5%) toCGS13R: 38%, A: 19%.Activity: Active against S. aureus 10 MRSA strains (MIC 3-6 uM).Toxicity: murine RBC: HC50 >320 uM. HC10 >320 uM (poorly hemo.lytic). Not toxic to HEK293 cells (IC50 > 320 uM).Structure: it became helical in 50% TFE.Peptide stability: evaluated in MRSA supernatant or blood plasma: a quarter to half left after 12 h incubation and the peptide is essentially degraded after 24 h.Resistance development:no:bacteria:S. aureus: after 7 passages, it did not develop resistance to MRSA while methicillin did.Animal model:mouse: the peptide reduced bacteria by 5-6 log when the skin abscesses were treated at 40 mg/kg. A similar effect was achieved when treated with 5 mg/kg vancomycin.",
