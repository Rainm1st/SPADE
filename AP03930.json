    "Literature": "Peptide discovery: C-terminal truncation of residues 23-33 of pardaxin 4.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is highly similar (80.95%) topardaxin derivative 18P.Activity: active against E. coli D21 (MIC 40 ug/ml), A. calcoaceticus Ac11 (MIC 2.5 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 50 uM), S. typhirnuriunz LT2 (MIC 40 uM), B. megateriurn Bm11 (MIC 0.8 uM), M. luteus ATCC 9341 (MIC 2 uM), and B. subtilis ATCC 6051 (MIC 1.2 uM).SAR: this fragment was only active against one bacterial strain but became more active after C-terminal amidation. The recorded form is amidated.Toxicity: human RBC: <20% lysis at 50 ug/ml.",
