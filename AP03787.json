  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: it is another form isolated from the same bacteria strain. This form differs from the previously isolated peptide (AP00635) only at the C-terminus, with one extra W. It is unclear whether this is a different form or the previous one results from protease degradation. Hence, it is treated as a different peptide at this stage.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (97.3%) toMesentericin Y105.Activity: active against L.mesenteroides Y 105 (MIC 263 uM), L. ivanovii 496 (MIC 34 nM), L. paramesenteroides 19 (MIC 38 nM), L. curvatus DSM 20 019 (MIC 708 nM), L. sake DSM 20 017 (MIC 37 nM), C. divergens DSM 20 623 (MIC 538 nM), and C. piscicola DSM 20 730 (MIC 742 nM).SAR: this 37-residue form, with W37, is 10,000-fold more active than the 36-residue peptide originally isolated.Structure: no structure in aqueous solution but became helical in 50% TFE.",
