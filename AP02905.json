    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide shows 42% similarity toFusaricidin D. An alternative for the last residue is Leu. The N-terminus is acetylated and dehydrated threonine is proposed to form an ester bond with the C-terminal carboxyl group.Activity: Active against S. aureus NCIM 2901, 5021, and 2127 strains (MIC 2-16 ug/ml), including most MRSA strains (MIC 8-64, but can also be 512 ug/ml).
