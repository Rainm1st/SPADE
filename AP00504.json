    "Literature": "Discovery:  Derived from the C-terminal region (residues 32-51, where 7 out of 8 basic residues are located) of MUC7 domain 1.Activity:Activity was initially reported in a previous study (Smith CJ and Bobek LA 2001 J Dent Res 80:601). Active against bacteria A. actinomycetemcomitans (ED50 4.37 uM),  E. coli (ED50 1.61 uM), P. aeruginosa (ED50 4.41 uM), S. mutans cariogenic bacteria (ED50 1.39 uM), P. gingivalis (ED50 <1 uM), and S. gordonii (MIC 2.43 uM),  fungi C. albicans DIS or azole resistant (ED50 2.40-5.85 uM), C. glabrata or fluconazole resistant(ED50 5.02-12.3 uM),  C. krusei (ED50 5.16 uM), and C. neoformans CN2 or amphotericin B resistant (ED50 4.05-4.29 uM), and S. cerevisiae (MIC 5.23 uM).SAR:  While Ca2+ and Mg2+ can compromise antifungal activitiy (this ref), Zn2+ coordination increased the MUC7 antimicrobial activity, indicating the importance of Zn for activity (Szarszon  et al., 2024). In addition, the peptide is still active after removing the first eight residues (MUC7 12-mer). In saliva (proteases and ionic strength), the D-form of MUC7-12mer is more active than the L-form, although they showed similar activity in phosphate buffer (PBS) (D=L).Structure:  The secondary structure prediction showed that MUC7 20-mer adopts an amphiphilic helix. Random coil in water and helical in TFE.MOA:fungi:C. albicans: the peptide can be internalized.Updated 12/2014; 6/2024.",
