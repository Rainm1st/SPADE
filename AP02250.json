    "Literature": "Active against L. lactis sp. lactis IL1403. Because only closely related L. lactis strains are inhibited, it exhibits a very narrow antibacterial spectrum. This peptide uses a metallopeptidase as the receptor (Uzelac G et al., 2013). A follow-up study reveals the 3rd domain is involved for binding (Miljkovic M et al. 2016).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure of LsbB bound to DPC micellesherein the PDB.  Structure in TFEhereis also available in the PDB. Updated 5/2014; 4/2016; 10/2017; 5/2019.GW",
