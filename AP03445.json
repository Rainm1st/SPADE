    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (91.89%) tohuman cathelicidin LL-37GRAVY:  -1; M. Wt: 4209.94; Mol formula: C191H316N56O50; Mol Ex Coeff: 0; This peptide is an activity reduced form generated by a pathogen to evade the killing of LL-37.Activity: less active than LL-37 against S. suis. At 4 uM, ~half log left after LL-37 killing and ~2 log left after LLGCP killing. Warning: other pathogens not yet tested.Structure: the peptide remains helical in 50% TFE or 30 mM SDS but less helical than LL-37.MOA:  The peptide can permeabilize bacterial membranes although less effective than LL-37.Chemotactic:  LLGCP also has reduced chemotactic effects in inducing cytokine release.NETs:  It also reduces NETs formation compared to LL-37.Innate evasion mechanism:  This study provides a mechanism for the S. suis infection. It uses the ApdS protease to reduce the antimicrobial potency of human LL-37.",
