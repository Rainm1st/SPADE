  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Chemical modification: An N-terminal lipidated cyclic antibiotic with nonstandard amino acid Dab at positions 1, 3, and 6 (Warning: Dab, 2,4-diaminobutanoic acid, is two CH2 units less than lysine, although represented by K here in the sequence), D-amino acids for F4 and V7. The ring structure is proposed to occur between the C-terminal carboxylic and hydroxyl group of the N-terminal fatty acid portion. PE1 and PE2 share the same peptide backbone but have different fatty acid chains (C-end-OCHRCH2CO-N-end: R is C4H9 for PE1 and C3H7 for PE2). Because of the same amino acid sequence, PE1 and PE2 share this AP number.Activity: Both compounds are active against S. epidermidis CMCC 26069, S. aureus ATCC  25923, S. aureus ATCC 43300, E. coli ATCC 35318, E. coli 5539, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, P. aeruginosa 5215, and fungus C. albicans ATCC 10231 (MIC 1-8 ug/ml), better than polymyxin B in certain cases.",
