    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide shows 76.3% similarity toAndroctonus defensin.  Molecular formula:  C177H295N71O43S6; Mol Wt  4311.144.    GRAVY= -0.52; Wimley-White whole-residue hydrophobicity of the peptide:  4.27  kcal/mol.Activity: MIC90 recorded here: Active against Gram+ bacteria S. aureus CNCC63202 (MIC 50 uM); M. luteus CMCC28001 (MIC 10 uM); M. bovis (MIC 0.5 uM) and Gram- bacteria E. coli CMCC44103 (MIC 5 uM); B. burgdorferi 297-GFP(MIC 50 uM) as well as fungi C-albicans CAU0037 (MIC >50 uM).AMP Significance: Till 2016, B. burgdorferi is the only bacterial pathogen recognized to be responsible for lyme disease which was transmitted to human via the bite of infected tick.
