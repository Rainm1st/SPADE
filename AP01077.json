    "Literature": "It inhibited HIV-1 infection in cultured human T-lymphoblast (CEM-SS) cells (EC50 1.21 uM) and cytotoxicity (TC50 >3.5 uM), therapeutic index (4)(Ireland et al., 2008). Cycloviolacins Y4 and Y5 are more hydrophobic (>50%) than cycloviolacin Y1 (33%), thereby more hemolytic.The same sequence has also been discovered from a different plant (Craik et al., 1999).
