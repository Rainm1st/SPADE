    "Literature": "Discovery: Found in multiple species.Activity: Activity against B. cereus (MIC 50 ug/ml), E.coli (MIC>100 ug/ml), L. lactis (MIC 1.5 uM), L. innocua (MIC 25 ug/ml), M. luteus (MIC 12 ug/ml), S. aureus ATCC 25923 or 29213 (MIC 3-12 ug/ml), S. epidermidis (MIC 12 ug/ml), S. uberis (MIC 12 ug/ml), E.clocae (MIC >100 ug/ml), P. multocida (MIC 12-25 ug/ml), and P. haemolytica (MIC 25 ug/ml) (same ref as AP2008).  MRSA (MIC <10 uM) and  A. baumannii (MIC < 10 uM), antibiofilm:S. aureus and A. bumannii.In addition, this peptide could inhibit HIV infection with little adverse effect on T cells (J Virol 2005; 79:11598-11606).MOA:bacteria: membrane activity is pH dependent as it contains three histidine residues (Sani et al., 2023). It caused more perturbation to membranes at acidic pHs.MOA:cancer:  Activated the IFN-alpha Response Signalling Pathway of Tumour Macrophages (Yang et al., 2022).Structure:  in 50% TFE, two well-defined helices from L2 to K11 and from V17 to H24 separated by a region of less-defined helicity and greater flexibility.Animal model:mouse: significantly inhibited the growth of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains in a murine skin infection model.Toxicity mechanism:  ssNMR F19 study in whole red blood cells suggests pore formation (Kumar et al., 2024).Updated 11/2015 GW. 4/2019 CW; 5/2020; validated 7/2021; Jan2023; 12/2024 GW",
