  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Native peptide is active against Gram+ M. luteus (MBC 0.13-0.25 uM), S. aureus (MBC 0.5-1 uM), and E. coli DH5alpha (MBC 0.25-0.5 uM). Due to a limited amount of material, additional assyas were conducted using a synthetic peptide. Also active against  B. megaterium (MBC 0.05-0.1 uM),   A. viridans (MBC 0.19-0.39 uM) , E. faecalis (MBC 0.78-1.56 uM), Gram-  P. aeruginosa (MBC 3.1-6.2 uM), K. pneumoniae, E. aerogenes, and S. typhimutium (MBC 0.39-1.5 uM). The differences between synthetic and native peptides are probably due to approximative estimation of native peptide amount given by\nEdman degradation protocol. Updated 2/2020",
