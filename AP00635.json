    "Literature": "91.89% similar to \tLeucocin A (AP00199). G: 22%; N: 11%.Activity: exhibiting a narrow bactericidal spectrum limited to genus Listeria such as L. monocytogenes.SAR: Removal of the N-terminal KYY led to the activity reduction to 0.04%. In addition, the absence of a single Trp residue of the mesentericin Y105 caused a 10,000-fold diminution of the anti-microbial activity. Seq corrected and updated 3/2023.",
