  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: EntL50 activity was maximally accumulated at 16 to 25°C and was not detected at 37°C or above.  leaderless, i.e. no signal peptide. The sequence of chain b (EntL50B) is MGAIAKLVFKFGWPLIKKFYKQIMQFIGQGWTIDQIEKWLKRH.Chemical modification: The N-terminal Met is formylated.Activity: EntL50A and EntL50B both possess antimicrobial activity on their own, with EntL50A being the most active. Supernatant containing Enterocin A5-11 inhibited several Lactobacillus spp. and food-borne pathogens E. coli, S. aureus and L. innocua.Synergy:AMPs:  when the two chains were combined, a considerable synergism was observed, especially with some indicator strains.Discovery: leaderless, i.e. no signal peptide.Peptide stability:  heat-stable and not sensitive to pH (pH-insensitive) (Batdorj  et al., 2006).Found in multiple species (both formylated and unformylated forms) (Hanchi et al., 2016).
