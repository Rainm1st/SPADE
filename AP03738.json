    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (58.82%) toHill-Cec5A: 19%; Q: 17%; V: 11%.  GRAVY: -0.65; Mol W: 5281.026; Mol formula:  C234H379N74O65; Mol Ex coeff: 8530.Activity: Active against S-aureus ATCC 6538 (MIC >32-64 uM), E. coli ATCC 8739 (MIC 0.25-0.5 uM), P. aeruginos (MIC 1-2 uM).Discovery: this sequence has also been reported in a different paper. Peptide H13 is active against E. coli ATCC25922 (MIC 3.0 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC700603 (MIC 3.3 uM), A.baumannii ATCC19606 (MIC 6.1 uM), P. aeruginosa CMCC10104(MIC 6.1 uM), V. parahaemolyticus ATCC17802 (MIC 3.0 uM), E-faecalis ATCC29212 (MIC >24.2 uM), B. subtilis BNCC109047 (MIC 1.5 uM), S-epidermidis ATCC35984 (MIC >24.2 uM), S-aureus ATCC6538 (MIC >24.2 uM), and C-albicans ATCC10231 (MIC > 24.2 uM) (Peng et al., 2023). In this H cecropin series, only H13 to H15 were active against P. aeruginosa. Updated 12/2023",
