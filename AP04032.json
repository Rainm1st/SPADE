    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (39.39%) toCoprisinGRAVY: 0.35; mol Wt: 6620.594; mol formula: C275H461N86O87S6; mol ex coeff: 5925.Chemical modification:  Disulfide bonds: C1-C4, C2-C6, and C3-C5.Activity: active against multidrug-resistant Gram- bacteria A. schubertii (MIC 125 ug/ml or 18.9 uM). Activity also observed in a diffusion assay.Recombinant production:yeast:Pichia pastoris GS115: the peptide was expressed (67.2%) and purified.Animal model:Fish: this peptide increased the survival (~60%) of fish infected with Aeromonas schubertii at above 25 mg/kg (untreated control: 20% survival). The peptide also down-regualted pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha.",
