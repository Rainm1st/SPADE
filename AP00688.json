    "Literature": "Discovery: present abundantly in uncleaved forms in horse neutrophils.Activity: Unlike eCATH-1 and eCATH-2, eCATH-3 did not show activity against the same panel of bacteria in MHB (MIC > 150 ug/ml).  However, it killed these bacteria under low ionic conditions.Fungi: Active against fungi various C. neoformans (MIC 9-18 ug/ml), R. rubra (MIC 37.5 ug/ml) but not C.albicans (MIC>114 ug/ml),C.parapsilosis (MIC>114 ug/ml), C.tropicalis (MIC>114 ug/ml), and P.etchellsii (MIC>114 ug/ml) in Sabouraud medium (not active in RPMI).   If the major function of eCATH3 is not antimicrobial,  this peptide could possesses other non-antimicrobial functions (Skerlavaj B et al., 2001).Antimicrobial robustness: The antibacterial and antifungal activity of eCATH3 appeared to be salt-sensitive since it had MICs of 2 to 20 mg/ml for bacterial cells in low-ionic-strength medium and is ineffective when tested up to 114 mg/ml in physiological salt medium.SAR: deletion of 4 or 6 N-terminal residues did not change peptide activity behavior at least under lab conditions.Structure:  helical in 30-45% TFE.In vitro toxicity: 10% human RBC 0.6% lysis at 468 ug/ml.Updated 7/2013; 10/2024.",
