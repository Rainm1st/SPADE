  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis revealed highest sequence similarity (94.7%) toDefMT6, differing only in two sites: K19G and S26A.Activity: Both longicin and longicin P4 are active against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and S. typhimurium. Active against equine parasite B. equi and canine B. gibsoni. Longicin mature peptide corresponds to residues 37 to 73 of the precursor protein. Longicin P4 corresponds to 53-73 (i.e., C-terminal fragment). Other inactive peptides include longicin P1 (residues 23-37), longicin P2 (residues 33-45), and longicin P3 (42-57).Animal model:mouse: The efficacy of the hemoparasiticidal activity of longicin was observed in vivo against a murine Babesia parasite, B. microti. In addition, the knockdown of longicin via RNAi showed a significantly increased number of B. gibsoni parasites in the midgut and the ovary. The peptide P4 is also active against parasite T. gondii tachyzoites by causing aggregation and memrbane damage (Tanaka T et al., 2012). Longicin P4 (sequence SIGRRGGYCAGIIKQTCTCYR) is demonstrated to have antiviral effects on Langat virus (LGTV) (Talactac MR et al. 2016). Updated 4/2016.",
