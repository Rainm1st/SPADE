    "Literature": "Discovery: The 5 gene cluster elxABCOP, one for export and three for immunity, has been found. The production is media condition dependent. The medium containing 10% Lab-Lemco meat extract, 2% NaCl, 20 mM NH4Cl, 3% malt extract, and 0.4% Ca(OH)2 produced the highest concentration of epilancin 15X at 3 mg/L (Vel√°squez et al., 2011).Chemical modification: There are three thioether rings: S12-C16, T20-C23, and T22-C25. In addition, S2, T7, T8, and T28 are dehydrated. Finally, the N-terminus of the peptide is hydroxyl-propionylated (Hop, similar to acetylation). The 2011 paper reported the N-terminal D-lactate is converted from a serine residue modified by enzymes.Peptide stability: the lactate form is protected from degradation by aminopeptidase.Activity: Active against S. epidermidis, resistant bacterial strains MRSA and VRE  (anti-VRE). Also active against S. simulans (MIC 100 nM), M. flavus (MIC 75 nM), bacteriostatic, and B. megaterium (MIC 100 nM), bacteriocidal (Wang et al., 2023).Structure: It is similar to epilancin K7 in sequence and structure.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.MOA:bacteria:Disruption of the Lipid II cycle in intact bacteria using several methods led to a decrease in the activity of epilancin 15X, implying a possible interaction between the peptide and lipid II (BBW).Updated Jan2013.
