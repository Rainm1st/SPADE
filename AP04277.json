  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (92.5%) toPlectasinW=R: 50%. Three changes were made to increase net charge: D9Q, M13V, Q14K.Activity: diffusion assay: Active against L. ivanovii ATCC 19119 (16.67 mm), E. faecalis CICC 1.2024  or CICC 1.2136 (10-19 mm), B. bifidum CICC 1.2212 (17.33 mm), B. licheniformis CICC 1.265 (12.67 mm), B. coagulans CICC 1.2407 (17 mm), S. epidermidis ATCC 26069 (14.33 mm), and S. aureus ATCC 25923 (34.44 mm) but not E.coli. MIC: S. aureus ATCC25923 or ATCC29213 or ATCC6538 or ATCC43300 and 20 MRSA clinical strains (MIC 0.004-0.23 uM). 14-fold more active against MRSA ATCC43300 than NZ2114.Antimicrobial robustness: activity is pH-sensitive (better at basic pH) and not heat stable (loss of activity with an increase in temperature from 20 to 100oC).MOA:bacteria:C. perfringens (MIC 0.91 uM): showed an effect on membranes. Also binds DNA (Zong et al., 2016).Resistance development:no:bacteria:S. suis: S. suis did not develop resistance to MP1102 after 30 passages (Zhao et al., 2019).Structure: Unlike NZ2114, the structure of MP1102 is stable in the presence of SDS.Toxicity: human RBC: 0.05% hemolysis at 128 ug/ml (poor hemo.lytic).Recombinant production:yeast:Pichia pastoris X-33: one-step cation exchange chromatographyic purifficaiton from fermentation supernatant: rMP1102 yield: 197.1 mg/l at 96.4 % purity (Tricine-SDS-PAGE). A subsequent report: 5 L fermentor yield: 376.89 mg/l at 96.8% purity (Mao et al., 2015).Animal model:mouse: a mouse thigh infection model, infected with MRSA ATCC 43300, SC treated the peptide 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg, a dose-dependent efficacy was observed (CFU decrease 1.65 logs after 12 h treatment at 20 mg/kg).",
