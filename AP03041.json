  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: Initially isolated in 1984 (Argiolas A et al. 1984 J Biol Chem 259:10106-11).Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (78.6%) toMastoparanGRAVY: 1.28; Mol Wt: 1507.959; Mol formula: C72H135N17O16.Structure: In 50% TFE, it is helical.Activity:  Active against E. faecalis (MIC 4-8 uM), S. aureus or MRSA (MIC 2-32 uM), E. coli (MIC 4-8 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 8-64 uM), and C. albicans (MIC 4-8 uM). Also, active against Gram+ B. cereus ATCC 11778 (MIC 4 uM),  L. monocytogenes ATCC 15313 (MIC 8 uM), Gram- S. enterica ATCC 13076 (MIC 32 uM) (combined with new data from ref for AP4034).SAR: Cyclization via terminal  S-S bond reduced peptide activity (MIC 32 or greater). However, appending a cell-penetrating sequence (the TAT peptide) to the N-terminus had little effect on MIC. It also showed antibiofilm activity against S. aurues (MBIC 4 uM; MBEC 64 uM) and P. aeruginosa (MBIC 32 uM; MBEC 128 uM). MP-C also inhibits cancer cells H157, MBD-MB-435S, PC-3, U251-MG, and MCF-7 (IC50 6-25 uM).Toxicity:  Cell selectivity is very limited as IC50 for normal cell lines HMEC-1 and horse erythrocytes (horse RBC) are 40-57 uM (mnoderate hemolytic).
