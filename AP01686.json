    "Literature": "Active against fungal A. niger, A. versicolor, F. moniliforme, F. solani, N. crassa (IC50 0.34-10 ug/ml). Psd2 pea defensin shows a preference for mimetic membrane rafts enriched with glucosylceramide and ergosterol (do Amaral VSG et al. 2019). NMR structure reveals hydrophobic cluster on the surface probably responsible for peptide activity (Pinheiro-Aguiar et al. 2019).You can rotate, zoom, and view the complex structure with ribosomeherein the PDB.
