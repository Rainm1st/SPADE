    "Literature": "Study questions: Asian toad has been used as a wound-healing agent in traditional Korean medicine. Did AMPs help there? Also detected in bovine, porcine, and human stomach (Found in multiple species, FIMS). Its location on mucosal surfaces of vertebrate stomach plays an important role in innate defense against invading microbes.Discovery: Buforin I is produced from cytoplasmic histone H2A by the action of pepsin in the gastric gland cells of the Asian toad.Activity:  This histone-derived peptide is active against Gram+ bacteria B. subtilis, S. aureus (MIC 4 ug/ml), S. mutans (MIC 8), S. pneumoniae, P. putida (MIC 4 ug/ml), Gram- bacteria E. coli (MIC 8 ug/ml), S. typhimurium (MIC 4 ug/ml), Serratia sp. (MIC 8 ug/ml), fungi C. albicans, C. neoformans, and S. cerevisiae (MIC 4 ug/ml).SAR: Synthetic derivatives: buforin II. Updated 11/2011; 10/2016; 7/2021",
