Active against E. coli PTCC2433, K. pneumoniae PTCC4231, P. aeroginosa PTCC2834, B. subtilis PTCC4533, L. mesenteroides PTCC1445, B. cereus PTCC1435, A. niger, A. fumigates, and C. albicans (MIC 15-30 ug/ml). It showed 2.9% hemolysis at 100 ug/ml, much less hemolytic than the most similar peptide Mastoparan B.",
