Helixity increases in TFE.NMR structurehas been solved.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Activity: Active against B. subtilis (MIC 0.4 uM), E. coli (MIC 8.6 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 15 uM), and C. albicans (MIC 3.6 uM).SAR:  Misfolded or partially folded peptides were much less active or inactive. Substitution of the four Cys with Ala or alkylation caused a loss of activity. However, under reduced conditions, the peptide is still rather active. Updated 12/26/2013, 4/2016; 7/2021; 3/2022",
