  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "MOA: P18 kills cancer cells by disrupting membranes (Tang C et al 2010 Org Biomol Che 8:984-7). Changing P9 to S9 (S9-P18) increases alpha-helicity. Changing P9 to L9 (L9-P18) also increases alpha-helicity. Higher alpha-helicity of these derivatives are involved in the hemolytic and antitumor activity rather than antibacterial activity.",
