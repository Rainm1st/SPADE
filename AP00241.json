  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity against L. lactis (MIC 25ug/ml), B. cereus and S. epidermidis (MIC 50ug/ml). By similarity to Caerin 1.1, it contains two amphipathic helices separated by a region of less-defined helicity and greater flexibility. This peptide could inhibit HIV infection (VanCompernolle et al., 2015). Updated 6/2015.",
