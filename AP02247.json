    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD prediction and calculation: mol weight:  5898.083;  Mol formula: C279H451N69O67S1. Sequence alignment revealed its similarity (49%) toAureocin A53 (AP1131). leaderless.Chemical modification:  The N-terminal methionine of lacticin Q is formylated. Bacteriocins that lack leader or signal sequences are expected to have N-formylmethionine at their N termini.Activity: Active against L. acidophilus JCM 1132T (MIC 0.24 nM), B. cereus JCM 2152T, B. coagulans JCM 2257T, L. lactis ATCC 19435T (MIC 2.7-5.3 nM), B. circulans JCM 2504T, E. faecalis JCM 5803T or JCM 5804T, E. mundtii QU 2, L. alimentarius JCM 1095T, L. sakei JCM 1157T, L. mesenteroides JCM 6124T, L. innocua ATCC 33090T (MIC 33-70 nM), B. subtilis JCM 1465T, E. hirae ATCC 10541, L. lactis NCDO 497, L. brevis JCM 1059T, L. coryniformis JCM 1164T, P. pentosaceus JCM 5885 (MIC 110-330 nM), M. luteus IFO 12708, L. casei JCM 1134T (MIC 790- 900 nM), S. aureus ATCC 12600T (MIC 1.8 uM), and S. salivarius JCM 5707T (MIC 7.2 uM).  Lacticin Q showed antibacterial activity comparable to that of nisin A in terms of both intensity and spectrum.MOA:bacteria:  This peptide, as well as nisin A, can cause ATP efflux. A recent study suggests the mechanism of action (MOA) is related to the accumulation of toxic hydroxyl radical (Li M et al 2013).SAR: Removal of the N-terminal Met had no effect on peptide activity.Antimicrobial robustness: However, it retained its antibacterial activity after heat treatment under alkaline conditions, which completely inactivated nisin A.Structure:You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.updated: 4/2016; 8/2023; 12/2024.",
