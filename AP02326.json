Active against Human non-small lung cancer cells A549. MIC against  P. aeruginosa (20 uM). It is found that a phospholipid-specific mechanism of membrane permeabilization, through interaction with phosphatidylethanolamine-lipids, is essential for cyclotides active primarily on Gram-negative bacteria (Strömstedt AA et al., 2017). 7/2021",
