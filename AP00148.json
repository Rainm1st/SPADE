    "Literature": "Activity:  Active against Filamentous fungi A. fumigatus (MIC 1 uM), A. niger (MIC 0.25 uM), A. terreus (MIC 32), N. crassa (MIC 0.06), T. rubrum (MIC 0.25 uM), yeasts C. albicans and S. cerevisiae (MIC 2-4 uM) (Huber et al., 2018). Active against F. oxysporum.Structure: Amino acid sequence was reported and disulfide bonds were formed between Cys7-Cys33, Cys14-Cys40, Cys26-Cys28 and Cys49-Cys51 (Nakaya K, et al. Eur J Biochem. 1990 Oct 5;193(1):31-8). Solution structure was solved by Campos-Olivas R et al.
