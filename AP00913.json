  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Active against fungi A. longipes (50% inhibition IC50 3 ug/ml), B. cinerea (IC50 12 ug/m), C. sphaerospermum, F. culmorum (IC50 1 ug/m), P. digitatum (IC50 3 ug/m), T. viride (IC50 6 ug/m), and V. alboatrum (IC50 3 ug/m).Antimicrobial robustness:  Salt-sensitive: 50% inhibition concentration increased dramatically to the range of 50 to >200 ug/ml when the medium was supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2 and 50 mM KCl. Also active against N. crassa, B. cinerea, F. culmorum (IC50 0.5-1.5 uM), S. cerevisiae, and P. pastoris (IC50 15-16 uM).Chemical modification: The N-terminal glutamine is cyclized (pyroglutamate). It potentially contains two S-S bonds (6-16 & 7-20).Structure: The NMR study was reported and found no regular helical nor beta-sheet structure. It is therefore a non-alaphbeta structure with several turns. Structural calculations reveal preferred disulfide bonds: C6-C16 and C7-C20  (Patel SU et al  1998. Biochemistry. Jan 27;37(4):983-90).SAR: A linearized all-D amino acid mutant is also active against yeast and fungal strains (Thevissen K et al. 2005 Peptides 26: 1113-9). Updated 7/2021",
