    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE shows 98.1% similarity toArmadillidin H. Rich in glycines (47%). There are six repeated motifs GGGF(H/N)(R/S). Active against B. megaterium F04 (MBC 4.75 uM) and P. syringae DC3000 (MBC 1.18 uM). Very rapid killing started at 30 s and 5 min. Membrane targeting.\n.",
