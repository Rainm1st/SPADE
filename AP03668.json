    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (89.74%) tohBD-28R=W: 33%; G=N: 17%.  GRAVY: -0.76; M Wt: 4555.596; Mol formula: C195H339N63O49S6; molar extinction coeff: 3355.Activity: active against E. coli. Additional strains to be tested.Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-insensitive:E. coli (150 mM salt); CaCl2-insensitive:E. coli (0.2 mM physiological); MgCl2-insensitive:E. coli (2 mM physiological); KCl:sensitive:E. coli (100 mM physiological).Toxicity: less than 10% hemolysis up to 120 ug/ml (little hemo.lytic). Also, ~90% smooth muscle cells survived up to 120 ug/ml.",
