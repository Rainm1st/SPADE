    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE shows 50% similarity toPhylloseptin-B1. Predicted to be helical.Activity: Active against S. aureus (MIC 8 ug/ml), E.coli (MIC 128 ug/ml) and C. albicans (MIC 8 ug/ml). In addition, it exhibited anti-proliferative activity against the human cancer cell lines, H460, PC3 and U251MG, but was less active against a normal human cell line (HMEC). Updated 7/2021",
