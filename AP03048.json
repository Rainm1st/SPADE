  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 66.7% similarity to its parent peptideNigrocin-RE1 or nigrocin-HL.Activity:  Active against S. aureus NCTC10788 (MIC 2.9 uM), E. coli NCTC10418 (MIC 12 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC27853 (MIC 47 uM), and C. albicans NCYC1467 (MIC 2.9 uM). Clearly, the peptide is more active against Gram+ bacteria and fungi.Structure: Helical in 50% TFE.SAR:   Interestingly, replacement of the \"Rana box\" of nigrocin-HL with a Phe followed by C-terminal amidation led to nigrocin-HLM, with enhanced activity against resistant pathogens such as MRSA (MIC 1-4 uM). The modified peptide nigrocin-HLM at 8 uM eradicated MRSA-biofilm, while nigrocin-HL was unable to up to 16 uM. Nigrocin-HLM is less hydrophobic and not hemo.lytic in vitro (HC50 512 uM; cf. 64 uM for the parent peptide).Animal model:mouse:  when i.p. injected, nigrocin-HLM did not cause death of mice at 20 or 40 mg/kg while the parent peptide did (animals died in 7 days).
