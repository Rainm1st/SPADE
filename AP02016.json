    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (79.07%) toSl moricinK: 21%; I=G: 12%; V=A: 10%. Antibacterial activity and 3D structure were determined by Dai et al (J Pept Sci2008).Activity: active against Gram- E. coli 0157H7 ATCC 25922 (MIC 6.25 ug/ml), S. typhimurium ATCC 14028  (MIC 6.25 ug/ml), K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883 (MIC 6.25 ug/ml), S. typhimurium DT104 ATCC 700408 (MIC 6.25 ug/ml), Gram+ L. monocytogenes ATCC 19115 (MIC 6.25 ug/ml), S. aureus ATCC 25923 or MRSA 43300 or MRSA BAA-39 (MIC 6.25-12.5 ug/ml).Structure:  Secondary structure was evaluated by CD (helical in SDS, methanol, or 50% TFE) and NMR and 3D structure was determined in methanol. As in the case of Bm and SL moricins, a long helix (residues 5-36) followed by a proline 37 was found. Similar to SI moricin, its C-terminal tail contains a disordered cluster of basic amino acids, mainly lysine.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. Updated 2/2014; 4/2024.",
