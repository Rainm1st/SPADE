    "Literature": "Active against E. coli (MIC 55 uM). It contains one disulfide bond: 18, 24. R. sphenocephala is an interesting model frog species because it did not decline although it lives in regions with observed B. dendrobatidis endemics. It is found that AMPs from this species is active against pathogenic chytrid fungus B. dendrobatidis (MIC 40 uM) (Holden WH et al., 2015), one possible reason that might have caused the frog decline.
