    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (46.67%) tofrog Odorranain-V1A peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 14 amino acids of human CXCL10 (see AP02080). I=V=C=T=S=R=R: 14%. GRAVY: 0.9; M Wt: 1547.91; Mol formula: C65H118N20O19S2; Mol ex coeff: 125.Activity: P1 kills B. anthracis Sterne 7702 bacilli (EC50 18.1 uM), B. anthracis bacilli lacking the FtsX component of the FtsE/X complex (EC50 53.1 uM), B. subtilis 168, Gram-negative K. pneumoniae NDM-1 clinical isolate BL13802, K. pneumoniae BL13802 at 50 uM, reduced the viability of A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, S. typhi, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli clinical isolate FI-4531 that expresses mcr-1, S. faecium, and S. aureus at 5. 6 uM. It also inhibited the dormant and hardy spore form of B. anthracis. It also showed minimal chemotactic activity at 50 uM, much less effective than the parent CXCL10.Structure: it is random coil in Kph buffer-only or 50% TFE, but became beta-sheet (positive at 192 nm and negative at 220 nm) in liposomes that mimic bacterial membranes. This sequence appears to be improtant for killing since a sequence scrambled peptide was not bactericidal.Updated 12/2024",
