ALso active against viruses such as white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) by binding to the virus\nenvelope protein WSSV189.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. In addition, a synthetic peptide corresponding to a part of the putative LPS-binding site of ALFPm3 was shown to display activities primarily against Gram-positive bacteria, indicating the full polypeptide is required for antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Structure was derermined by NMR using unlabeled and 15N-labeled samples (Yang et al., 2009). Updated 2/2014; 11/2014.",
