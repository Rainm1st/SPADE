  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Active against E. coli (MIC 0.32 uM), S. coag. neg. spp (MIC 1.02 uM), Propionibacterium spp (MIC 1.16 uM), S. aureus (5.17 uM), and C. albicans (MIC 0.56 uM). Activity is salt-sensitive, despite less than CCL20 or HBD2. In addition, Dai et al. found that CXCL14 is active against respiratory tract bacteria P. aeruginosa, S. mitis,  S. pneumoniae in a dose-dependent manner (J Immunol 2015).  Activity against Gram-negative bacteria is largely located in the N-terminal peptide (residues 1-13). The central part of the molecule maintains 62% killing activity and sufficient to attract THP-1 cells.  CXCL14-C17 corresponding to the C-terminal helical region is active against bacteria and anti-inflammatory(Rajasekaran et al., 2019). Updated 5/2015; 2/2019; 11/2019 GW.",
