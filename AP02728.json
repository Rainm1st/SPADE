    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE shows poor sequence similarity (52.2%) tosiamycin.Chemical modification:  S-S bonds: C1-C13 and C7-C19.Activity: Sviceucin showed moderate activity against Gram+ bacteria BUT NOT Gram- bacteria or fungi. Most sensitive strains include B. megaterium, L. bulgaricus 340, S. aureus ATCC 6538, L. sakei subsp. sakei DSM 20017, and a closely related Streptomyces sp. 523 (MIC 1.25-2.5 uM).Structure:You can rotate, zoom, and view the lipid II bound 3D structureherein the PDB.
