  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: FK-16 (residues 17-32 of LL-37) was identified as the major antimicrobial peptide of human cathelicidin LL-37 by NMR-trim.  GF-17 = G + FK-16:  mol wt 2102.5.Chemical modification:  Both GF-17 and FK-16 are C-terminally amidated.SAR:   FK-16 and GF-17 have similar antibacterial activity, indicating the N-terminal glycine has a minimal effect (Wang et al., 2019).Activity: Active against E. coli ATCC 25922, K. pneumonia ATCC 13883, P. aeruginosa PAO1, and S. aureus USA300 MRSA (MIC 3.1-6.2 uM). More active against a mprF mutant strain (Golla R. et al., 2020).Virus: inhibited Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 HIV-1 (EC50 0.98 uM, TC50 8.9 uM) (Wang et al., 2008), Zika virus (ZIKV) (He et al., 2018)FK-16 was demonstrated to have anticancer activity in vitro in 2006 (see the ref) and in vivo in 2013 against colon cancer cells (Ren SX et al. 2013).Structure:   In complex with membrane-mimetic micelles, GF-17 has a helical structure and interfacial R23 and K25 were found to be essential for antibacterial activity as well as membrane penetration, primarily against G- bacteria (Wang G et al. 2012).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure of GF-17 bound to SDS micellesherein the PDB.Synergy:phaged-encoded endolysin: The MIC of FK16 treated with LysPB32 against STPMB was decreased from 64 to 32 ug/ml against S. Typhimurium (Kim et al., 2025).Surface immobilized peptide: FK-16 shows antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities against a variety of pathogens after covalently immobilized to the titanium surface (Mishra and Wang, 2017).Peptide formulation: FK-16 after formulated with chitosan and liposome lost activity, perhaps not released due to binding  (Han et al., 2024).Peptide engineering:17BIPHE2 was designed based on the 3D structure of GF-17d3, which contains three D-amino acids at positions 20, 24, and 28 (numbered as in LL-37) (Wang et al., 2014). 17BIPHE2 is active against the ESKAPE pathogens (MIC 3.1-6.2 uM). Both GF-17 and 17BIPHE2 inhibited Zika virus (He et al., 2018).Updated 4/2013; 10/2013; Jan2014; 4/2016; 4/2017;3/2018; 6/2019; 8/2021; 11/2023; 8/2024; ref link updare 10/2024.Go to PubChemfor additional information.",
