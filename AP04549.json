  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (92.31%) toparent peptide BmKn2I: 25%, L=A: 17%.Activity: inhibited biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa, strongest in this truncated peptide series. Only this peptide in this series also inhibited bacterial growth, indicating all other peptides are only weak antibiofilm peptides.Structure: predicted to be helical.In vitro toxicity: sheep RBC: hemolytic. Toxic to L929 cells as well.",
