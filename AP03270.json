Helical bound to SDS or LPS ((binding affinity Kd 5.53 uM).Activity: Active against Gram- E. coli (MIC 6.25 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 25 uM), Gram+ S.aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC >100 uM), B. subtilis CMCC 63501 (MIC 6.25 uM),  P. acnes ATCC 6919 (MIC 1.56 uM), and fungal C. albicans ATCC 10231 (MIC 12.5 uM).  Also,  inhibited the enzymatic activities of tPA, plasmin, b-tryptase, elastase, and thrombin by 50.7%, 17.7%, 82.0%, 11.1%, and 8.6%, respectively.MOA:bacteria:E. coli:  MOA:bacteria:S. aureus: permeated bacterial memrbanes.Structure: random coil in water and helical in SDS or LPS according to CD studies. ITC confirmed LPS binding (Kd 5.53 uM).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.In vitro toxicity: 2.6% hemolysis of murine RBCs at 212.8 ug/ml (poor hemo.lytic).In vivo toxicity:mouse: Injected at 10 mg/kg did not appear to cause acute toxicity after 7 days.Animal model:mouse: survival study: septic mice injected with LPS can die. The injection of the peptide protects 70% of the mice from death (treated 1 h after LPS challenge). Anti-inflammatory.Reg. 7/2021; updated 11/2023; 12/2024",
