    "Literature": "Activity: Zone inhibition assays: Active against E. coli D 21(lethal concentration LC 0.2 uM), B. megaterium BmII (LC 0.1 uM), S. aureus Cowan 1(LC 0.4 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC15692 (LC 0.7 uM), C. albicans (LC 0.5 uM) and S. cerevisiae (LC 0.9 uM).  (MIC data provided by Chunfeng Wang).Toxicity: hRBC: > 100 uM.SAR: Residue 1-18 appears to contain the antimicrobial region that forms predominantly a helical conformation in TFE (Biopolymers2012). An amphibian antimicrobial peptide variant expressed in Nicotiana tabacum confers resistance to bacterial or fungal phytopathogens. Also showed insecticidal effect.Transgenic plants: A M28L mutant was expressed in plants. The morphology of transgenic plants was unaffected. Challenging these plants with bacterial or fungal phytopathogens demonstrated enhanced resistance up to the second generation. Moreover, transgenic plants (e.g. Nicotiana tabacum) displayed insecticidal properties (Biochem J. 2003 Feb 15;370(Pt 1):121-7). This peptide promotes insulin secretion in acute 20-min incubations with glucose responsive BRIN-BD11 cells (Marenah L et al., 2006), thereby of interest for type 2 diabetes (T2D).
