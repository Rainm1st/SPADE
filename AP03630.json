    "Literature": "AMP Significance: CRAMP appears to promote liver repair after acetaminophon-induced injury (Zhai et al., 2023).Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (97.06%) toCRAMP-1This is the isolated natural form. K: 24%; L=G: 12%. GRAVY: -0.89; M. Wt.: 3878.64; Mol Formula: C178H303N49O46; Mol Ex Coeff: 0.Activity: active against E. coli (MIC 3.12 uM), S. typhimurium (MIC 3.12 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 3.12 uM), B. subtilis (MIC 6.25 uM), S. pyogenes (MIC 6.25 uM), S. aureus (MIC 3.12 uM), C. albicans (MIC 12. 5 uM), A. fumigatus (MIC 12.5 uM), tumor cells: A549 (IC50 22 uM), K562 (IC50 28 uM), Jurkat (IC50 16 uM). It also displayed antibiofilm activity against P. aeruginosa (Wang et al., 2023).Antiviral:  inhibited Enterovirus 71 (EV71).Toxicity: 2.2% hemolysis at 100 uM (hemo.lytic) (Data from ref for AP3628. This peptide differs from the natural form only by the last Q, which is neutral presumably with a minimal effect on activity). UPdated 10/2023",
