  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (84.62%) toPep-39. R: 38%; L: 23%; F: 15%. GRAVY: -0.646; M Wt: 1797.233; M formula: C83H141N31O14, mol ex coeff: 0.Activity:  it inhibited MRSA (MIC 20 uM). SEM revealed morphological changes in MRSA after treatment.Toxicity: MTT assays: 10-100 uM, not toxic to HeLa cells.Structure:  CD spectra did not support a clear helical structure in SDS or TFE.",
