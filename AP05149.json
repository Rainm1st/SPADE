  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is 71.43% similar toCombi-1. R: 50%, W: 33%, Q: 17%.Activity: Active against B. subtilis ATCC6633 (MIC 7.5 uM), S. aureus 42D (MIC 30 uM), and E. coli ML35 (MIC 60 uM) (Nguyen et al., 2010). Non-standard assays in 1% TSB.Structure: 3D determined by NMR in SDS micelles. The two Trp rings appeared to be perpendicular to some extent.SAR: Lfc1 (without C-terminal amidation): reduced peptide activity;   Lfc3 (N-acetylation): this modification (reduced positive charge) substantially reduced peptide activity ; Lfc4 (both N-acetylation and C-terminal amidation): reduced activity compared to Lfc2; Lfc5 (head-to-tail cyclization): increased peptide activity.",
