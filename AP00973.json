  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Phylloseptin-L1 was active against S. aureus (MIC 8 uM). This peptide also inhibited growth of B. dendrobatidis zoospores at concentrations above 25 uM with complete inhibition at 100 uM.Toxicity:  Phylloseptin-L1 was approximately equipotent against both HepG2 cells (LC50 35 uM) and erythrocytes (LC50 40 uM).Discovery:Xi X et al(2013) identified the same peptide in a different frog from Central America. Their peptide was active against S. aureus (MIC 8 mg/L) and C. albicans (MIC 32 ug/mL).Toxicity: Hemolytic 80% at 128 ug/mL (HC50 ~70 ug/ml), moderate hemolytic. Found in multiple species.
