    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (85%) toPhylloseptin-PBa1.Activity: Active against S. aureus (MIC 5 uM), C. albicans (MIC 15 uM), and very very weak E.coli (200 uM). It also exhibited anticancer activity, including the human metastatic breast ductal carcinoma cell line MB435S.Toxicity: The peptide is highly hemolytic (HC50 = 15.8 uM). 7/2021",
