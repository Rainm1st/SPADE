  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (86.4%) toRuminococcin C5. This substantce was originally reported byRamare F et al., 1993and disapperared from rat feces when injested a trypsin inhibitor.Activity: Active against the Gram-positive lab and clinical strains of bacteria: C. perfringens (MIC 0.4-0.8 uM against clinical strains), C. difficile (MIC 0.3-0.6 uM), L. monocytogenes (MIC 0.8 uM), B. cereus (MIC MIC 1.2-1.6 uM), S. pneumoniae (MIC 0.3-0.6 uM), E. faecalis (MIC 2.5 uM), and E. faecium (MIC 1.2 uM) (data from the 2020 structural paper below).  Also B. subtilis (MIC 6 uM).Chemical modification: The ref paper also characterized post-translational modification and found four pair of S-Calpha-thioether bonds, which are C22-N35, C24-A31, C41-K61, and C45 and R53 (the mature peptide was continually numbered after the 19-residue leader sequence).Structure: 3D structure has been determined by 3D NMR spectroscopy (Roblin et al., 2020).You can rotate, zoom, and view the complex structure with ribosomeherein the PDB.
