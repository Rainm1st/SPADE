  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "AMP Significance: Achromonodin-1 is naturally encoded by certain isolates from the sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis.Chemical modification: it forms an eight-membered macrolactam ring between Gly1 and Glu8.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (39.39%) toUbonodinG=P: 17%; L=N: 10%. GRAVY: -0.52; M Wt: 3219.627; Mol formula: C148H220N33O43S1; mol ex coeff: 8530.Activity: active against A. pulmonis, an isolate from the sputum of a cystic fibrosis patient.Structure: due to limited solubility in water, the peptide was solubilized in CD3OH. NMR studies confirmed the lasso structure with Lys28 and Tyr29 serving as the upper and lower steric locks of the ring structure. It has the largest experimentally determined loop structure of 20 amino acids.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: the peptide was expressed and induced via IPTG in M9 minimal media. After two rounds of HPLC purification, peptide yield was ~0.5 mg/L.Peptide stability: thermostable at 37 and 65oC but not at 95oC probably due to unthreading.",
