    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 27.5% similarity toCarnolysin.Discovery: Vatamin A deficiency increases the risk of skin infection. Why? Hooper and colleagues found that vitamin A can induce the expression of human resistin, which has antimicrobial effect. This deepens our understanding of the role of vitamins in skin innate immunity. Read thecommentary hereof this work. For a review, seeLi et al. 2021.Activity: Active against S. epidermidis,  S. pyogenes,  and L. monocytogenes.Antimicrobial robustness: RELMalpha bactericidal activity is pH-sensitive. RELMalpha bactericidal activity is inhibited by cholesterol.updated 7/2019; 7/2021.",
