  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Chemical modification:  There are two thioether rings (T8-C13 and T10-C32) and one unique disulfide bond between C21-C29 (Lin et al. 2010 Microbiol Res 166: 146-154).Activity: Active against B. megaterium AS1.941, B. subtilis AS1.1087, L. curvatus LTH1174, L. mesenteroides AS1.2, L. dextranicum 181, and M. flavus NCIB8166 based on zone of inhibition (10-21 mm).MOA:  similar to nisin, bovicin HJ50 showed both peptidoglycan precursor lipid II-binding ability and pore-forming activity(Zhang J et al., 2014).Structure:  highly flexible in water with varying rigidity for the ring structure with the ring A being most rigid.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Important note: Thermophilin 1277 (T Kabuki et al., 2007) shares the same sequence with bovicin HJ50 (APD entry 1607) prior to post-translational modifications. A followup study concluded at two rings and one disulfide bond (Kabuki et al. 2009 J Appl Microbiol. 106:853-62). It remains to be established whether bovicin HJ50 and thermophilin 1277 are actually identical. Macedovicin (original AP2221) was found to have the same gene clusters as  thermophilin 1277 (Georgalaki et al., 2013). Hence, it has been merged with this entry. Found in multiple species.
