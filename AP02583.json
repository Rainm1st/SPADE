  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Initially reported as pedptide C by Conlon et al. (Conlon et al., 1999). APD analysis reveals that the sequence of temporin-1s shows 50% similarity toTemporin-GH. Because of such a sequence similarity, the authors re-named peptide C as temporin-1S. Showed much weaker dose-dependent activity against pathogenic chytrid fungus B. dendrobatidis (MIC 250 uM). For additional peptides with higher activity against this fungus, please refer toAP453;AP454;AP455). Temporin-1S is predicted to be helical.",
