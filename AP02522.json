  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: This defensin was first reported to be ZnCl2 induced and confer zinc tolerance(Mirouze M et al., 2006). The four consecutive residues (Val39-Phe40-Pro41-Ala42) are strictly conserved for plant defensins able to tolerate zinc.Chemical modification: N-terminus is a pyroglutamate. The sequence of this entry is 94.1% SIMILAR TOplant Ac-AFP4.Activity:  Active against the filamentous fungus F. oxysporum (MIC 0.6 uM), A. brassicola (MIC 2.5 uM), S-cerevisiae (MIC > 20 uM),  C-albicans (MIC >20 ug/ml), E-coli (MIC>20 uM), and M. luteus (MIC 15 uM).Is antifungal activity biologically relevant?:  The Zn tolerance and antifungal activity depends on cellular localization:  when applied exogenously, it is toxic against fungi; however, it serves as zinc responser when expressed in yeast cells.Structure:  The 3D structure of this peptide obtained by chemical synthesis has been determined (Meindre F et al., 2014).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: see ref.Updated 11/2024",
