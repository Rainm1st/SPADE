  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: The N-terminal 18-residue fragment showed an even broader activity spectrum. This peptide promotes insulin secretion in acute 20-min incubations with glucose responsive BRIN-BD11 cells (Marenah L et al., 2006), thereby of interest for type 2 diabetes (T2D).Structure:  Solution structure of esculentin-1b(1-18) was determined in the presence of DPC  or a mixture of DPC/SDS micelles (Manzo G et al., 2014).Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: A direct expression of the intact peptide was unsuccessful, so the peptide was expressed as a fusion. Esculentin-C, a recombinant form of esculentin-1b with a change M28L and one additional M at the C-terminus, was found to be active against E. coli D21 (MIC 0.2 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 15692  (MIC 1.4 uM), Y. pseudotuberculosis YP III (MIC 0.1 uM),  P. syringae pv tabaci, E. agglomerans Bo-1S (MIC 0.3 uM), G+ B. megaterium Bm11 (MIC 0.1 uM) and S. aureus Cowan I (MIC 0.4 uM).Toxicity: human RBC, lethal concentration > 200 uM.Variant: esculentin-L, the recombinant linear form (no Rana box dilsufide bond), showed antibacterial activity and hemolytic toxicity similar to the one with S-S bond (esculentin-L) and esculentin-1a.Updated 12/2018; 5/2020; formatted 12/2023",
