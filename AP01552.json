Of outstandding interest is that a belt of positively charged residues is sandwiched by TWO hydrophobic patches on the peptide surface. Such a structural feature provides a model for explaining bacterial aggregation by this AMP.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Updated 2/2014; 2/2024.",
