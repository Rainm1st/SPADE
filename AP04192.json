    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (93.55%) tofrog \tpredicted Dermaseptin-DA2, i.e., DRS-DA2NEQ also isolated in this studyK: 17%; V=L=K: 14%. GRAVY: 0.096; mol Wt: 3081.705; mol formula: C138H243N36O37S1; mol ex coeff: 5550. This isolated form is two residues shorter than the originally predicted and also isolated form (see the above link). Althought not tested, another form, DRS-DA2NE, which contains one extra E at the C-terminus compared to the current entry, was also isolated. It should have an activity spectrum similar to AP00959.Activity: Active against Gram- E. coli ATCC 8739 or K12 or ML35p or resistant p7 (MIC 0.8-3.2 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027 or ATCC 27853 (MIC 3.2-12.5 uM), K. pneumoniae CIP 52.211 (MIC 0.8 uM), K. oxytoca CIP 7932 (MIC 3.2 uM),  S. enterica CIP 8297 (MIC 12.5 uM), Y. ruckeri ATGG 29473 (MIC 3.2 uM), Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 6538 or ST 1065 or MRSA (MIC 1.6-25 uM), S. epidermidis BM 3302 (MIC 6.3 uM), L. monocytogenes SOR 100 (MIC 25 uM), E. faecalis CIP A186 (MIC 50 uM), L. garvieae ATCC 43921 (MIC 50 uM), E. faecalis CIP 103015 (MIC 6.3 uM), and K. rhizophila ATCC 9341 (MIC 0.8 uM).Structure:  it is helical in POPE:POPG (75:25) LUVs.MOA:bacteria:E. coli: induced membrane permeabilization.",
