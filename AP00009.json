    "Literature": "Rich in P (46.5%).Activity:  Active against E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 12 ug/ml), S. enterica serovar typhimurium LT2 or ATCC 14028 (MIC 12-25 ug/ml), K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883 (MIC 25 ug/ml), and E. cloacae ATCC 13047 (MIC 25 ug/ml) (provided by Chunfeng Wang), P.vulgaris ATCC 13315 (MIC>200 ug/ml), P.aeruginosa ATCC 7700 (MIC>200 ug/ml), S.epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC>200 uM), S.aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC>200 ug/ml), and S.agalactiae (MIC > 200 ug/ml).SAR: Fragments of Bac5 was generated to identify the minimal sequence required to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. Deletion of amino acids from the C-terminus reduces peptide activity. Bac5(1-17) is the smallest active peptide, while bac5(1-25) is most active.MOA:bacteria:  These peptides appear to be transported into E. coli via sbmA transporter and then bind to the exit tunnel of ribosome (Mardirossian M et al., 2018).
