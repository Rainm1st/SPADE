  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (56.63%) toHgeScplp1 including Hge36K: 18%;  V: 10%; GRAVY: -0.51; M Wt: 8509.965; M formula: C366H617N103O110S7; mol ex coeff: 3355.Activity: rEv37 and truncated peptides showed no cytolytic activity against bacteria (B-subtilis, S-aureus or E-coli at 20 uM). Another report: rEv37 can inhibit dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infections in a dose-dependent manner at IC50 2-5 uM, not toxic to host cells (Li et al., 2019).MOA:virus: direct killing and restricts viral late entry (viral membraneâ€“ endosomal membrane fusion with low pH dependence) by alkalizing acidic organelles.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: recombinant peptide was used to test channel-blocking activity.SAR: both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains are required for channel inhibitory activity.Toxicity: human RBC: no hemolysis at 10 uM. no effect on HEK293 cells at 5-10 uM. However, this toxin inhibited K channel Kv1.3 at 1 uM but not Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 channels (HEK293 cells).",
