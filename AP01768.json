    "Literature": "Active against E. coli D31 (MIC 21 uM), S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (IR715) (MIC 29 uM), L. monocytogenes (MIC 12 uM), and S. pseudintermedius (clinical isolate) (MIC 11 uM). Except for the last species, this peptide appeared to be slightly less active than human LL-37 against Gram-negative bacteria.Structure: It (50 uM) is disordered in water but becomes helical in 10 mM SDS micelles. Like LL-37, it also can associate with DNA based on the gel retardation experiment. Updated 7/2021",
