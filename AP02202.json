    "Literature": "56.3% similar toLf-CATH2. APD calculated: Molecular weight: 3419.16; molecular formula: C151H264N46O39S2; Wimley and White hydrophobicity: 8.34 kcal/mol; potentially one disulfide bond between C3-C7.Antimicrobial activity: Active against Gram-negative E. coli ATCC25922 (MIC 1.37 uM), E. coli 08A852 CI/DR (MIC 1.37 uM), E. coli 08A866 (MIC 2.74 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC27853 (MIC 5.48 uM), P. aeruginosa 08031205 (MIC 9.38 uM), P. aeruginosa 08031014 (MIC 10.95 uM), Gram-positive S. aureus ATCC2592 (MIC 2.74 uM), S. aureus 08A865 (MIC 2.74 uM), and S. aureus 08A875 CI/DR (MIC 5.48 ug/ml). Also active against fungi C. albicans ATCC2002 (MIC 1.37 uM), C. albicans 08022821 CI/DR (MIC 2.74 uM), C. albicans 08022710 (MIC 5.48 uM), and C. albicans 08030809 CI/DR (MIC 1.37 ug/ml).Antimicrobial robustness: Cathelicidin-PY retained similar antimicrobial activity in the presence of 150 mM NaCl, PBS, CaCl2 and MgCl2 against E. coli, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and C. albicans.SAR: The S-S bond did not appear to be essetnial for antimicrobial activity since C to A changes only increased MIC two fold in cation-adjusted MHB (see also AP03600).Toxicity: it did not show significant toxicity to mammalian cells (hRBC and raw 264.7 murine macrophage cells). Data not found.Anti-inflammatory: This cathelicidin also exerts anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting the production of nitric oxide (NO) and inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1).Structure: The peptide was random coiled in water or PBS, but became helical in membrane-mimetic SDS or TFE (CD). The 3D structure was determined by NMR in the presence of 40% TFE (52% of the residues are in the most favored Ramachandran region and 44% in additionally allowed region). The folded structure is unusual and different from the structures of other known helical cathelicidins.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Peptide engineering: head-to-tail cyclization by forming a peptide bond led to a decrease in helicity and antibacterial activity, indicating the importance of the helical structure for antimicrobial activity of cathelicidin-PY (Dissanayake et al., 2023).
