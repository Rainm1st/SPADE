    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (45.1%) toC. mydas cathelicidin 1K: 27%; G: 19%; I: 15%. GRAVY: -0.69; M Wt: 5188.34; M formula: C234H419N77O54.Activity: Active against Gram- E. coli ATCC8739 (MIC 2 ug/ml), S. typhimurium ATCC14028 (MIC 8 ug/ml), K. pneumoniae CMCC46117 (MIC 16 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa CMCC10104 (MIC 16 ug/ml), Gram+ S. aureus CMCC26003 or ATCC 43300 (MIC 16-64 ug/ml) MRSA 64 ug/ml; S. mutans ATCC 700610 UA159 (MIC 4 ug/ml). It also inhihited biofilm formation and expression of virulence factors.Toxicity: caused 6.46% and 4.29% cell death of HaCat and RAW 264.7 cells, respectively, when treated at 100 ug/ml. Sheep:RBC: extremely low hemo.lytic at 100 ug/ml (1.46%).Peptide stability: remained potent after 6 h incubation with saliva. After 24 h incubation, MIC increased to 42 uM, indicating protease cleavage.Structure:  random coil in water and helical in SDS.",
