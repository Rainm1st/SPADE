  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 37.7% similarity toMyticin C. Authors found a unique disulfide bond connection pattern: C1-C8, C2-C6, C3-C5, and C4-C7.Activity: Preferentially active against marine bacteria, but very weakly in vitro. Activity tested against Gram- terrestrial E.coli (MIC >100 uM), P.aeruginosa (MIC >100 uM), marine Y.ruckeri (MIC >100 uM), L.anguillarum (MIC >100 uM), A.salmonicida (MIC 200 uM), Gram+ terrestrial C.glutamicum (MIC 50 uM), S.aureus (MIC >100 uM), C.maltaromaticum (MIC 200 uM), C. mobile (MIC 100 uM), C.divergens (MIC 200 uM), and C.funditum (MIC 200 uM). It remains to be tested whether the peptide is more active at low temperature where the crab lives.",
