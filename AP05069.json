    "Literature": "Discovery: isolated from spider venom via HPLC. Whole sequence was then obtained by comparing the detected sequence with the transcriptome data.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is 44% similar toMeucin-24K: 24%. GRAVY: -0.876; mol Wt: 3088.76; mol formula: C140H235N39O35S2; mol ex coeff: 1490.Chemical modification: C-terminal amidation.Activity: active against Gram- S. typhimurium CGMCC 1.1174 (MIC 2.5 uM), E. coli CCTCC AB 2018675 (MIC 5 uM), S. dysenteriae CGMCC 1.1869 (MIC 2.5 uM), P. aeruginosa CGMCC 1.596 (MIC 5-10 uM), K. pneumoniae (MIC 10 uM),  A. baumannii (MIC 5-10 uM), Gram+ S. aureus CMCC 26003 or MRSA ATCC 43300 (MIC 5 uM), and E. faecium (MIC 2.5 uM). Bacterial killing effect.inhibited biofilm formation:bacteria:E. coli and S. aureus; disrupted preformed biofilm:bacteria:E. coli and S. aureus (24 h).Resistance development:no:bacteria:E. coli: Both E. coli and Resistance development:no:bacteria:S. aureus did not develop resistance to this peptide after 21 passages.MOA:bacteria:E. coli: MOA:bacteria:S. aureus: permeated bacterial membranes by forming pores.Structure: largely random coil in water and helical in TFE (50%).Peptide stability:  heat-stable after exposure at 80oC or 100oC for 1 h.Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-insensitive:E. coli (150 mM), KCl-insensitive:E. coli (4.5 mM), NH4Cl-insensitive:E. coli (6 uM), MgCl2-insensitive:E. coli (1 mM), CaCl2-sensitive:E. coli (2.5 mM); NaCl-insensitive:S. aureus (150 mM), KCl-insensitive:S. aureus (4.5 mM), NH4Cl-insensitive:S. aureus (6 uM), MgCl2-insensitive:S. aureus (1 mM), CaCl2-insensitive:S. aureus (2.5 mM).In vitro toxicity: 10.13% hemolysis at 320 uM: poorly hemo.lytic. Low toxicity to normal cells LO2, HEK293T, cancer cells HepG2, and HONE-1, but toxic to mouse breast cancer cells 4T1 (IC50 20 uM).In vivo toxicity:mice:IM: No death or notable toxic effects were observed.Animal model:mouse: netropenic mice thigh infection model, treated 2 h post-infection, reduced CFU by 1.35 log after 48 h (i.m./i.m.).Synergy:antibiotics: only showed synergistic killing with levofloxacin against S. aureus (FICI 0.31).Est.12/2024; updated 4/2025",
