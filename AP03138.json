    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence of chain A (RosA1) is most similar (42.1%) tolantibiotic Subtilomycin. It contains 4 thioether rings and one S-S bond. The sequence of Chain RosA2  is GSGVLGTLGCCSCLPWYSGWTVCGLACNPGKPCKN containing 6 thioether rings, more than other beta chain. This is the first two-chain lantibiotic from a non-Firmicute.Toxicity:  Inhibition zone: A single chain is inactive but becomes active when combined against Gram+ bacteria. L. monocytogenes  MTCC 839 (+++), B. subtilis MTCC 121 (+++) but weakly against E. coli MTCC 1610. Edited 7/2021",
