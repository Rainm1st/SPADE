  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide most resembles (36.6% similarity)human CCL11.  After bacterial (marine bacteria E. tarda and V. harveyi) or viral (megalocytivirus) infection, CsCCL21 expression was significantly induced in kidney, spleen, and liver. Animal model:fish: the numbers of bacterial cells (E. tarda and V. harveyi) recovered from rCsCCL21-administered fish were significantly lower than those from the control fish. It also displayed chemokine effects to PBL and a mutation of CC(27-28) abolished the chemotactic effect. It enhances the expression levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha (i.e., Pro-inflammatory). Thus, this antimicrobial chemokine has a dual role in inflammatory immune response.",
