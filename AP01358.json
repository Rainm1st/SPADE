  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "It showed activity against B. subtilis, S. aureus, including MRSA from patients. Using 64 overlapping synthetic peptides, it was found that a peptide corresponding to residues 19-30 is most active. However, the peptide can be further shortened to residues 20-30, which is active against bacteria but shows poor hemolytic toxicity (Saido-Sakanaka, H et al. 1999 Biochem J 338: 29-33).",
