  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "The structure consists of five helices (H1:6-16; H2: 24-36; H3: 45-50; H4: 58-66; and H5: 70-78) and three S-S bonds (C6-C80, C9-C74, and C35-C49). There are two conformations in solution due to pro isomerization. 81 Pro Cis conformer is presented. The protein construct for structural studies contains a His-tag at the N-terminus.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.
