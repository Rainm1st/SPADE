  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: FK-13 is the core antimicrobial peptide corresponding to residues 17-29 of LL-37.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (92.31%) toKR-12.  R: 23%; I=F=K: 15%. GRAVY: -0.44; M Wt: 1719.106; M formula: C80H135N25O17, mol ex coeff: 0.Activity: Active against E. coli KCTC 1682 (MIC 16 uM), P. aeruginosa KCTC 1637 (MIC 32 uM), S. typhimurium KCTC 1926 (MIC 16 uM), Gram+ B. subtilis KCTC 3068 (MIC 4 uM), S. epidermidis KCTC 1917 (MIC 16 uM), and  S. aureus KCTC1621 (MIC 16 uM) (Rajasekaran et al., 2017). Also S. hominis (MIC 39 uM) (See AP4772).Virus: inhibited Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 HIV-1 (EC50 3.4 uM, TC50 10.4 uM) (Wang et al., 2008). It also reduces the viability of T. vaginalis on a 5-nitroimidazole-sensitive and a 5-nitroimidazole-resistant strain (RamÃ­rez-Ledesma et al., 2022).Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-insensitive:E. coli (100 mM) (Sol et al., 2015).Toxicity: human RBC: HC50 > 256 uM, not hemo.lytic.Structure:  Two structures are available in the PDB: (1) the membrane bound structure determined by NMR spectroscopy in 2005 (see the ref).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. (2) Remarkably, FK-13 by itself was found to form alpha-amyloid (amyloid AMPs?) in the crystal structure where the monomeric helical structure of FK-13 packs together (Engelberg and Landau, 2020). View the structurehere. Molecular simulation revealed hydrophobic interactions involving I24 (as named in LL-37) is critical for helical aggregate formation (Mitra and Paul, 2023).Anti-inflammatory: weakly suppressed NO 10.7%, and TNF-alpha 3.9% (cf. LL-37: 100% and 90.4%, respectively).Synergy:phaged-encoded endolysin: The MIC of FK13 treated with LysPB32 against STPMB was decreased from >512 to 128 ug/ml (Kim et al., 2025).SAR: Reversal of the sequence of FK-13 led to an LL-37-derived aurein 1.2 analog (LLAA, i.e. retro-FK13; sequence RLFDKIRQVIRKF), which remained active against E. coli (Li X et al. 2006 Biochim Biophys Acta 1758: 1203-1214). While FK-13 is also active against HIV-1, retro-FK13 is not (AP03808).\nUpdated 7/2024",
