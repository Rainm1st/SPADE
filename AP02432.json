  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "The cell-free fermented broth was active against both Gram+ and Gram- bacteria. The purified peptide was active against M. luteus (MIC 6.3 uM), V. cholera (MIC 25.4 uM). However, the reduced form of this peptide was found to be more active and M. luteus, L. monocytogenes, and V. cholera were most sensitive.The structure was predicted as a 2-stranded beta-sheet.
