    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 81.8% similarity toMarcin-22. molecular formula: C129H202N32O28; Mol Wt: 2649.21; GRAVY =-0.018. Helical in 50% TFE.  This is the native sequence andthe previous reported Meucin-18can be treated as a fragment of Meucin-22. The newly extended four residues RKKE are all charged.Activity: Active against Gram+ and Gram- bacteria. Active against B. megaterium CGMCC 1.0459 (lethal concentration LC 3.72 uM), B. subtilis CGMCC 1.2428 (LC 1.86 uM), M. luteus CGMCC 1.0290 (LC 2.71 uM), methicillin-sensitive S. aureus CGMCC 1.89 (LC 1.35 uM), penicillin-sensitive S. epidermidi P1111 (LC 1.61 uM), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative S. aureus p1369 (LC 2.21 uM), MRSA P1374 (LC 0.87 uM),  penicillin-resistant S. epidermidis P1389 (LC 0.56 uM), S. aureus J685 (LC 2.66 uM), S. aureus J698 (LC 2.66 uM), S. aureus J700 (LC 2.66 uM), S. sanguinis ATCC 1.2497 (LC 3.37 uM),  S. salivarius ATCC 1.2498 (LC 4.22 uM),  S. mutans ATCC 1.2499 (LC 2.39 uM),  and S. warneri ATCC 1.2824 (LC 3.76 uM).Structure: helical in 50% TFE.
