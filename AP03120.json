Mol Wt:  3306.684; GRAVY:  -1.98; Mol Formula: C141H221N44O42S2.Activity:  Active against Gram+ bacteria B-cereus (MIC>50 uM), B. subtilis (MIC 25-50 uM), S-aureus (>50 uM), S-epidermidis (MIC >50 uM), Gram- bacteria P-aeruginosa (MIC >50 uM), P-fluorescens (MIC >50 uM), P. stutzeri (MIC  6.25-12.5 uM), A-hydrophila, E-coli, S-flexneri, V-parahaemolyticus, V-alginolyticus (MIC>50 uM), fungi C-albicans (MIC>50 uM), amd C-neoformans (MIC 12.5-25 uM). Dose-dependent LPS stimulation led to its highest expression at 12-24 h.  Updated Jan2020; 7/2021",
