  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Active against Gram-positive B. megaterium, B. subtilis (IC50 40ug/ml), M. luteus, S. carnosus, and Gram-negative N. cinerea as well as the yeast S. cerevisiae (IC50 50ug/ml). Also inhibits S. aureus and B. cereus (Sadr et al., 2017). Found in plasma in 2000 and in urine in 2001.SAR: Truncated forms have been found in urine as well.Structure:  The originally proposed 4 disulfide bridgs have been revised in 2009 to: C7-C22; C10-C13; C11-C19; C14-C22 (Jordan JB et al 2009 J Biol Chem 284: 24155-24167).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.   Although it showed antimicrobial activities in vitro, this peptide might be the long-sought hormone that regulates iron homeostasis in humans. A pathogen will survive if it can figure out a way to steal iron from the host.  APD updated 6/2012; Jan2014; 2/2017 ; 4/2019 GW/CW.",
