    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: Like all penaeidins, it contains a N-terminal Pro-rich domain (PRD) and Cys-rich domain (CRD) at the C-terminus of the peptide. The PRD domain is required for the proper folding of the CRD with several S-S bonds.Activity: Active against Filamentous fungi F. oxysporum (MIC 0.84-1.26 uM), B. cinerea (MIC 4.38-6.57 uM), P. crustosum (MIC 1.26-1.9 uM), bacteria Gram+ A. viridans (MIC 1.9-2.92 uM), M. luteus (MIC 1.9-2.92 uM), B-megaterium (MIC > 50 uM), S-aureus (MIC> 50 uM), Gram-  E. coli 363 (MIC 22-33 uM), V-vulnificus (MIC>50 uM), S-thyphimurium (MIC>50 uM), and K-pneumoniae (MIC>50 uM).Structure: mainly disordered, but contain a helical region.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Updated 2/2014; 12/2024.",
