    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence  is 25.9% similar torat defensin DEFB24.Activity: Active against E. coli.Antimicrobial robustness: The activity is structure deppendent and salt-insensitive.MOA:bacteria:  DEFB118 caused rapid outer and inner E. coli membrane\npermeabilization.Toxicity: However, DEFB118 did not exhibit any hemolytic activity on rat erythrocytes.Biology: DEFB118 (initially known ESC42, located on chromosome 20q11) expression is restricted to the epididymis and is regulated by androgen. The protein is present in epithelial cells of efferent ducts and most abundant in the caput epithelium, where it is present in the lumen and located on sperm (Liu Q et al., 2001).Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli. The bacterial transformants yielded more than 250 ug/mL DEFB118 protein after 4 h induction by 1.0 mM IPTG. Updated 7/2021",
