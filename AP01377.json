  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Chemical modification: The native peptide has a modified amino acid at position 20 that, based upon mass spectrometry data, is probably a hydroxylated tryptophan.SAR: Synthetic piscidin 4 (with an unmodified tryptophan at position 20) has similar antibacterial activity to that of the native peptide.Activity: Piscidin 4 demonstrates potent, broad-spectrum, antibacterial activity against a number of fish and human pathogens, including multi-drug resistant bacteria. Active against fish pathogens S. iniae (MIC 4.7 uM), L. garvieae (MIC 9.41 uM), V. anguillarum (MIC 1.18 uM), A-salmonicida (MIC >37.54 uM), human pathogens E. faecalis (MIC 1.18 uM), S. aureus (MIC 1.18 uM), S. flexneri (MIC 1.18-2.35 uM), and E. coli (MIC 9.41 uM). Its minimum parasiticidal concentrations (PCmin 0.59 uM; PC100 1.18 uM).Structure: It adopted a weak helical conformation in TFE(Park NG et al.,2011). Updated 4/2024",
