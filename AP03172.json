    "Literature": "Discovery: The same peptide Suicin 90-1330 has also been found in Streptococcus suis in 2014 (LeBel et al., 2014). Found in multiple species.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (66.7%) toNisin J. Thioether rings may form between S3-C7, T8-C11, T13-C19, T23-C26, and T25-C28. Nisin P is three amino acids shorter than nisin A at the important pore-forming C-terminal domain. So the absence of  rings B and E in 50% of the nisin P peptides may contribute to reduced activity (see Table 4, ref).Activity: Active against L. bulgaricus LMG 6901  (MIC 10 nM), E. faecium 4955 (MIC 260 nM), S. aureus 7016 (MIC 530 nM), S. capitis 20G (8.5 uM), S. simulans 2B10 (MIC 0.53 uM), S. epidermidis 99 (MIC 34 uM), L. gallinarum Lac43 (MIC 8.5 uM), L. frumenti Lac53 (MIC 1.06 uM), L. reuteri Lac54 (MIC 8.5 uM), L. paracasei LacR1 (MIC 17 uM), L. plantarum Lac 29 (MIC 1.06 uM), L. mucosae Lac28 (MIC 1.06 uM), L. reuteri Lac 56 (MIC 69 uM),  L. lactis NZ9800 (nisin A producer) (MIC 8.5 uM), S. uberis strain 42 (nisin U) (MIC 4.25 uM), and S. agalactiae DPC 7040 (nisin P) (MIC 17 uM). It has inhibitory activity against L. bulgaricus LMG 6901. It can lose activity due to storage at pH 3-8.Updated 9/2020; 7/2021; Jan2024",
