  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Linear form is more active against B. megaterium ATCC 14581 (MIC 12.5 uM), M. luteus ATCC 9341 (MIC 100 uM), inactive: B.subtilis ATCC 6051, and E.coli ATCC 25922 (MIC >200 uM) (PMID: 19852990). Unlike LEAP-1 (hepcidin), LEAP-2 is not involved in iron response. Further, it is neither mitogenic nor chemotactic. It is induced (expressed) in response to bacteria or LPS. In epithelial cells, two variants are expressed and located intracellularly (lacking signal sequences) (Howard A et al. 2010 Cell. Immunol 261 (2), 128-33). 3D Structure: The central region of the peptide is folded into a beta-hairpin and a 310-helix while both ends are disordered. The C-terminal region is not required for membrane binding and disulfide bond is not needed for antibacterial activity (Henriques ST et al, ChemBioChem 11, 2148-57).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.  The functional role of LEAP-2 is beyond antimicrobial (Al-Massadi  et al., 2018). Updated 19/9/2010; 12/2011; 2/2014; 7/2018; Jan2020; 7/2021.",
