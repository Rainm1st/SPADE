    "Literature": "Discovery: Obtained by further shortening OH-CATH30 followed by residue substituions.Sequence analysis: 53.33% similar to SA-CATH (AP03077). K: 50%; F: 20%; V=A: 10%. M Wt: 2399.059; GRAVY: -0.62.Activity: Active against E. coli ATCC 25922 or ML-35p or 6 clincal strains (1.56-12.5 ug/ml), E.cloacae (MIC >100 ug/ml), E. aerogenes (MIC 12.5 ug/ml),  4 P. aeruginosa (MIC 6.25-12.5 ug/ml), H. influenzae (MIC 3.1-6.25 ug/ml), K. pneumoniae (3.1-6.25 ug/ml), Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 25923, ATCC 43300 MRSA (MIC 3.125-12.5 ug/ml), E. faecalis ATCC 29212 (25 ug/ml), and fungi: C.albicans (MIC >200 ug/ml).MOA:bacteria: Similar activity of D=L forms indicates membrane targeting.Toxicity: not hemo.lytic (HC50 >> 400 ug/ml); HaCaT cell line (60% dead at 200 ug/ml). mice: LD50 100 mg/kg i.p. or s.c.Animal model:mouse: Both OH-CATH30 and OH-CM6 displayed in vivo efficacy in reducing drug-resistant E. coli burdens in the neutropenic thigh infection animal model or murine bacteremia model. It also showed protective effects on E. coli induced rabbit urinary tract infection models (animal model:rabbit)(Zhang et al., 2013). The D-form of these peptides is also active in vivo although with higher cytotoxicity (Li SA et al. 2010). In addition, topical application of OH-CATH30 is efficacious against drug-resistant P. aeruginosa keratitis (Li SA et al., 2014).  This peptide also inhibits Escherichia coli ATP synthase (Azim et al., 2016).",
