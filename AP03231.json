    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (72.5%) toRugosin B. Mol Wt: 4414.154; Mol formula: C199H323N50O56S2; Mol ex coeff.: 7102.5; GRAVY: -0.47; L: 10%; A: 7%; S: 12%; N: 7%, K: 17%, one unpaired Cys.Activity: Active against E. coli, S. enterica, and P. aeruginosa and the fungus C. albicans (MIC 30 uM) but inactive against S.aureus. Brevinin-2SSb also possessed significant activities and, at concentrations of 4, 16, and 128 ug/mL, completely inhibited the growth of the plant pathogens: Gram-negative bacterium X. oryzae pv. oryzae, which causes a serious blight of rice; the Gram-positive bacterium C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis, which causes ring-rot disease in potatoes; and the fungus P. oryzae (synonym M. oryzae), which causes rice blast disease. Antioxidative activities of brevinin-2SS were evaluated using a standard 2,20-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) method.  The peptide showed a strong free-radical scavenging activity in a dose-depedent manner (20 ug/ml at 82.3%), due to the presence of a free Cys. The peptide is toxic to mammalian cells (32 ug/ml, survival rates of COS7, HepG2, and CPAE (11.5, 4.7, and 0.8%).  Peptide sequence kindly provided by Prof. Iwamuro.",
