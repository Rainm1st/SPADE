    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (96.67%) tohuman cathelicidin fragment KS-30GRAVY: -0.586; M. Wt: 2616.107; Mol formula: C118H200N36O30; Mol Ex Coeff: 0;pathogen cleavage: This peptide is a cleaved product of LL-37 by Staphylococcal aureus V8 protease at the Glu17-Phe17 bond. It cannot be further cleaved.Activity: It displayed actiity against S. aureus similar to LL-37. Active against E. coli (MBC 1.1 ug/ml), B. subtilis MBC 0.8 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa (MBC 1.6 ug/ml), and E. faecalis (MBC 4.5 ug/ml).",
