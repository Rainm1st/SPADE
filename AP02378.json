    "Literature": "Gageostatins possess the same amino acid sequence but different lipid anchor at the N-terminus. Gageostatin A has a C14 fatty acid chain; Gageostatin B: lipid: 3-beta-hydroxy-9,11-dimethyltridecanoic acid, C15 fatty acid;  Gageostatin C: lipid: (E)-7,9-dimethylundec-2-enoic acid, C13 fatty acid chain.Activity: Active against pathogenic fungi R. solani, B. cinerea and C. acutatum (MIC 4-32 ug/mL); moderately active against bacteria B. subtilis, S. aeureus, S. typhi and P. aeruginosa (MICs 8-64 ug/mL). In addition, Gageostatins 1-3 displayed cytotoxicity against six human cancer cell lines with 50% inhibition value EC50 values of 4.6-19.6 ug/mL. Updated 5/2016; 10/2021",
