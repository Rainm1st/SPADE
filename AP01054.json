NMR spatial structure of ternary complex Kalata B7/Mn2+/DPC micelle (Shenkarev ZO et al  J Inorg Biochem. 2008 May-Jun;102(5-6):1246-56). Divalent cation coordination is an invarint property of all cyclotides. Mn2+ was found to be coordinated with E7, T8, T13, and  Y15 (for details, go to the PDB).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. Updated 2/2014; 8/2019; 7/2021",
