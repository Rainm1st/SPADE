    "Literature": "Warning: Since the peptide sequence was not reported, the amino acid sequence showed here is a direct translation based on the nucleiotide sequence in the article. Whether the translated sequence corresponds exactly to the natural form remains to be established.Activity: inhibition zone assay: Active against Gram- bacteria E. coli, S. pullorum, and P. multocida (10.5 to 25 mm, 0.05-0.2 mg/mL).Recombinant production:bacteria: a His-tagged Escherichia coli prokaryotic expression system has been established.
