    "Literature": "Activity: Active against Gram+ A. viridans (MIC 0.6-1.2 uM), M. luteus (MIC 1.2-2.5 uM), B. megaterium (MIC 2.5-5 uM), B. subtilis (MIC 2.5-5 uM), S-aureus (MIC >40 uM), P. acidolactici (MIC 20-40 uM), Gram- E. coli (MIC 0.3-1.2 uM), S. typhimurium (MIC 0.6-1.2 uM), K pneumoniae (MIC 0.6-1.2 uM), E. cloacae (MIC 1.2-2.5 uM), E. carotovora (MIC 10-20 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 20-40 uM), fungi N. crassa (MIC 0.6-1.2 uM), N. crassa (MIC 1.2-2.5 uM), N. haematococca (MIC 1.2-2.5 uM), T. viride (MIC 1.2-2.5 uM), A. brassicola (MIC 2.5-5 uM), F. culmorum (MIC 2.5-5 uM), A. pisi (MIC 5-10 uM), and F. oxysporum (MIC 10-20 uM).SAR: C-amidated thanatin (i.e., A-thanatin) showed similar activity against bacteria and fungi. However, P. aeruginosa is 8-fold more sentive to the C-terminally amidated form.D-thanatin (all D-amino acids) showed similar activity against multiple Gram+ and fungi strains, but became much less active against Gram- bacteria, indicating some chiral configuration is needed (non-membranes?).L-thanatin=linear form,A T15S mutant (S-thanatin) binds LPS.C11tBu/C18tBu thanatin: peptide activity increased against M. luteus 3347 but reduced against E. coli when both C11 and C18 are changed to tert-butyl group (Imamura et al., 2008).Disulfide-bridge formation Between C11 and C18 is indispensable for antimicrobial activity and is closely related to the activity specificity towards bacteria (Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2008 May 2;369(2):609-15). The S-S bond is also important for salt tolerance and for pore formation in membranes.Antimicrobial activity decreases with the removel of more and more N-terminal residues (3 to 9).Toxicity:  porcine erythrocytes: Thanatin is not hemo-lytic at 40 uM.Structure:  A hairpin-like structure was found in solution (Mandard et al 1998 Eur J Biochem 256: 404).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.MOA: in 2019, it is found that thanatin can compete for LPS with divalent cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+, which are essential for membrane integrity. It also binds to the NDM-1 mettllo-beta-lactamase to replace Zn2+, inhibiting the hydrolase activity of this pathogen enzyme. This peptide also sensitizes the activity of antibiotics (Ma B et al., 2019).Recombinant production:yeast:Pichia pastoris: expression level 20 mg/L (Pipiya et al., 2023). Recombinant thanatin is also active against Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) (Sabokkhiz MA et al. 2019).Plant protection:rice: Trangenic plants: the thanatin transformant acquired a sufficient level of resistance to the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, presumably due to the repressive activity of thanatin to its initial stage of infection (Imamura T et al. 2010 Transgenic Res. 19:415-24).Peptide conjugate:phage: when fused with endolysin PA90 (Tha-PA90), the conjugate is more active  (MBC 0.5 uM) and can control A. baumannii in an animal model:mouse (systemic) by increasing murine survival (but not PA90 by itself) and decreasing bacterial burdens in major organs by 3 logs whem ip injected (600 ug per mouse) (Lim et al., 2024). Note that a conjugate of PA90 with cell-penetrating peptide did not show efficacy in mice (Lim et al., 2022).Updated 6/2010; 4/2019; 8/2019; 7/2021; Jan2024; 4/2024; 10/2024",
