    "Literature": "Chemical modification:  N-terminus is a pyroglutamic acid. C-terminal amidation. The N-terminus of Pen-3b (I10V) and Pen-3c (P14 deleted) may be Q or pyroglutamic acid.Structure: It contains a Pro-rich domain (PRD) from residue 10 to 28, which is disordered.  The cysteine-rich domain (CRD: residues 29-58) displays a folded structure (helix: 41-50; Cys32-Cys47; Cys48-Cys55; Cys36-Cys54). It is proposed that a cooperative interaction between the PRD and CRD domains is important for activity (J Biol Chem 2003; 278: 36859-67).Activity: active against M. luteus (MIC 0.6-2.5 uM), E. coli 363 (MIC 2.5-10 uM), F. oxysporum (MIC 5-10 uM), S.cerevisiae TGY (MIC >100 uM). Warning: non-standard assays against bacteria in 1% bactotryptone.Recombinant production:yeast:Saccharomyces cerevisiae: The recombinant form showed similar activity spectrum (Destoumieux et al., 1999). Pen-3aQ is a form with N-terminal Q. Additional antimicrobial assays were conducted using this peptide form: Gram+ bacteria A. viridans (MIC 0.3-0.6 uM),  B. megaterium (MIC 2.5-5 uM), E-faecalis (MIC >20 uM),  S-aureus (MIC>40 uM),  S-haemolyticus (MIC >40 uM),  Gram- (MIC 0.3-0.6 uM),  (MIC 0.3-0.6 uM),  V-harveyi (MIC >40 uM), V-alginolyticus (MIC >40 uM), V-penaeicida (MIC >40 uM), V-vulnificus (MIC >20 uM), S-thyphimurium (MIC >40 uM), K-pneumoniae (MIC >40 uM), E-cloacae  (MIC >40 uM), E-carotovora (MIC >40 uM), (MIC >40 uM), Filamentous fungi N. haematococca (MIC 1.25-2.5 uM), N. crassa (MIC 1.25-2.5 uM), A. brassicola (MIC 2.5-5 uM), B. cinerea(MIC 5-10 uM), A-fumigatus (MIC>20 uM), and yeast C-albicans (MIC > 20 uM).SAR:  glycosylation (Man) had little effect on activity against bacteria nd fungi tested.Updated 12/2024",
