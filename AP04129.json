    "Literature": "Discovery: seq scanned for encrypted antifungal region followed by amino acid changes.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (60%) topredicted Hs02I: 32%; F=R: 16%; K: 21%.Activity: active against C. albicans ATCC 90028 (MIC 5.0 uM), C-glabrata ATCC 90030 (MIC >20 uM), C. krusei ATCC 6258 (MIC 20 uM), C. parapsilosis ATCC 2209 (MIC 10 uM), C. tropicalis ATCC 750 (MIC 5.0 uM), C. guillermondii ATCC 6260 (MIC 2.5 uM). Minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) is the same as MIC or higher.Biofilms:fungi:C. tropicalis: at the MIC, it inhibited 81.8% biofilm formation and disrupted 87.3% preformed biofilm mass.Synergy:drug:  KWI-19 and antifungal amphotericin B showed synergistic effects against C. tropicalis (FIC 0.06).MOA:fungi:C. tropicalis: it showed membrane damage after 24 h incubation.Structure: KWI-19 is helical in memrbane-mimetic 50% TFE or SDS micelles.Toxicity: human RBC (HC50 ~10 uM), hemolytic. RAW 264.7 cell viability (IC50 64 uM).Animal model:wax moth: it protected the animals when treated with this peptide at 12.5 uM.",
