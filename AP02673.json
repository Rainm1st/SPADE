    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide most resembles (72.7% similarity)insect coprisin. Mol Wt:   4508.408; GRAVY: 0.30. Disulfide bonds are proposed between C1-C4, C2-C5, and C3-C6. Expressed in all tissues.Activity: Active against E-coli KACC 10005 (MIC >600 ug/ml) and Gram+ B-subtilis KACC 14741 (MIC >800 ug/ml) based on both radial diffusion and MIC assays using MBP fusion protein. Warning: Data on the puried peptide is missing.",
