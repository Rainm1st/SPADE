    "Literature": "Discovery: A peptide derived from the N-terminal region of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphatedehydrogenase (GAPDH).Activity: Showed bacteriostatic activity. Active against B. subtilis (MIC 3.2-11 ug/ml), M. luteus (MIC 9.5 ug/ml), S. aureus (MIC 11.3 ug/ml), S. iniae (MIC 13.5 ug/ml), Gram- A. hydrophila (MIC 14 ug/ml), E. coli D31 or ML35p or KCTC1116 (MIC 3.2-6.9 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa KCTC2004 (MIC 4.3 ug/ml), S. enterica KCTC2514 (MIC 3.6 ug/ml), S. flexneri KCTC2517 (MIC 4.8 ug/ml), S. sonnei KCTC2009 (MIC 9.3 ug/ml), V.  parahaemolyticus (MIC 6.2 ug/mL), and C.albicans (>125 ug/ml). Its activity was bacteriostatic.SAR: The C-terminally amidated form is more active.Toxicity:  no significant hemo.lytic activity (100 ug/ml 0.4-2.7% hemolysis).Updated 3/2016; 11/2024.",
