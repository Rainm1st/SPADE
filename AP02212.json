    "Literature": "Activity: Active against Gram-negative E. coli, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, Gram-positive S. aureus, B. subtilis, B. cereus, fungi C. albicans, A. niger, A. umigates (MIC 6-25 ug/ml). It is more active against E. coli and P. aeruginosa.  It showed 10% hemolysis at 100 ug/ml. Sarcotoxin Pd inhibited sperm motility in a dose-dependent manner: 100% at a dose of 90 and 80 ug/ml after 0.3 and 5 min, and 50% at after 15 min at lower doses (Zare-Zardini H et al., 2015).Toxicity: Significant cytotoxicity was observed at concentrations above 24 ug/ml.
