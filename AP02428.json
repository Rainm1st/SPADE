    "Literature": "Activity: Active against fungus F. graminearum that causes head blight disease in cereals.Structure:You can rotate, zoom, and view the NMR structure 2LR3herein the PDB.MOA:fungi: MtDef4 binds to phosphatidic acid (PA). PA is a precursor for lipid biosynthesis and a signaling molecule that recruits cytosolic proteins to membranes. MtDef4 rapidly permeabilizes fungal plasma membrane and is internalized by the fungal cells where it accumulates in the cytoplasm (see the structure paper PDB). Since the peptide can enter the cell, new evidence points at inhibition of protein synthesis of ribosome:MOA:fungi:B.  cinerea (Li et al., 2024).SAR: The sequence RGFRRR is likely the translolcation signal. Note that amino acid substitutions in the RGFRRR sequence not only abolished the ability of MtDef4 to enter fungal cells but also impaired its ability to bind PA.
