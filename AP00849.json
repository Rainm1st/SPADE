  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Lactococcin MMFII contains the N-terminal YGNGV consensus motif and is active against Listeria: L. ivanovii BUG 469 (generated 2mm zone of groth inhibition at 2.5 uM) and L. lactis cremoris 1160 (generated 2mm zone of groth inhibition at 1.42 nM). Thus, it belongs to the class IIa bacteriocins figuring the first example of such a bacteriocin produced by a lactococcal strain. See AP00923 for more info. Updated 7/2021",
