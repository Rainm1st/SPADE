  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: Originally discovered as neuropeptide in 2006 (Santic R et al 2006). It was termed alarin because of the N-terminal alanine and the C-terminal serine.Activity: In 2013, this peptide was demonstrated to have antimicrobial activity as well. Diffusion assay: Active against Gram-negative E. coli ML-35 (3 mm at 100 pmol).SAR: Deletion of the conserved N-terminal sequence (APAHR) reduced its antimicrobial activity, suggesting that APAHR is essential for its antimicrobial activity.MOA: Electron microscopy showed that alarin caused bacterial membrane blebbing.  Updated 11/2013; 6/2023.",
