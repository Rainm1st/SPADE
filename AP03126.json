    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (38.8%) toP11. Constitutively expressed. The peptide is N-acetylated and predicted to have no ordered structure.Activity: Active against both Gram+ (B. subtilis KCTC1021) and Gram- bacteria (E. coli). Note that although the purified peptide (native) showed potent antimicrobial activity, synthetic peptide did not show any antimicrobial activity.",
