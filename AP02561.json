  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence  is 40.2% similar toscorpion Scorpine. Active against rodent malaria P. berghei (10-20 uM inbiting 89-99%), lower than scorpine but higher than shiva-3 and gambicin. In this concentration range, it is slightly hemolytic to mouse blood cells 10-15%). The N-terminus, when studied alone by NMR, can be helical in TFE.  The C-terminus is predicted to have a  CS-alphabeta motif.",
