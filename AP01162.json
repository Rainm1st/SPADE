  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "N-terminus is blocked by pyroglutamate. This is the first finding of a plant antifungal peptide with a five-disulfide motif. The five S-S bonds are C1-C5, C2-C9, C3-C6, C4-C7, and C8-C10. EAFP1 and EAFP2 show characteristics of hevein domain and exhibit chitin-binding properties similar to the previously identified hevein-like peptides. They exhibit relatively broad spectra of antifungal activities against eight pathogenic fungi from cotton, wheat, potato, tomato and tobacco.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.
