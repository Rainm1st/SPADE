  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Active against E. coli and S. aureus (MIC 12.5 ug/ml). Also active against C. albicans KCTC 7270 or fuconazole-resistant strains CCARM 14001 or 14004 or 14007 or 14020 (MIC 2 uM; MFC 4 uM). Can also kill C. albicans in RMPI medium. At 2MIC, killed C. albicans in 120-180 min. Inhibited formation of biofilms:fungi:C.albicans formation at 4 uM (Park et al., 2024).MOA:fungi:C. albicans: It acted on the membranes: permeabilization and depolarization. ROS also detected.Structure:  It is helical in 60% TFE (CD). Can also be helical in the presnece of funal membrane component, laminarin.Toxicity: 2.65% hemolysis at 4 uM; 80% hemolysis at 30 uM, HC50=15 uM, hemolytic at high concentrations. 53.92% porcine kidney PK(15) cells survived when treated at 5 uM.Updated 7/2021; 4/2024",
