    "Literature": "Activity: Active against E. coli ML35 or ATCC 25922 (MIC 2-4 uM), S. typhimurium ATCC 14028 (MIC 8 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 16 uM), B. megaterium local isolate (MIC 2 uM), and S. aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC 4 uM) (see ref).Also C-termindated PMAP-23 antifungal against C. albicans (MIC 2.5-5 uM),  S. cerevisiae  (MIC 5 uM) and T. beigelii (MIC 2-5 uM) (Lee DG et al., 2001).Also exerted strong nematocidal activity against C. elegans.MOA:bacteria: MOA:fungi: permeated membranes.Structure:  Structure of the peptide in DPC micelles was determined by solution NMR. Two helical regions (residues 1-10 and 18-23) were found (Park K et al., 2002. Biochem Biophys Res Commun 290: 204-12). In addition, this peptide retarded DNA migration in the 0.8% agarose gel at ~10 uM (Baumann A et al., 2014.Updated 6/2014; 7/2016; 11/2024; 2/2025.",
