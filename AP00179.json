    "Literature": "Discovery:  Isolated from the azurophil granule fraction of discontinuous Percoll gradients followed by size-exclusion chromatographic purification.Activity: Active against E. coli, S. faecalis, and C. albicans.Chemical modification:  Three disulfide bridges.Structure: Beta1: residues 2-5, beta2: 14-21, beta3: 24-30.You can rotate, zoom, and view the monomeric crystal structureherein the PDB.MOA:bacteria: The L- and D-forms of HNP-4 are equally active (D=L) against both E. coli and S. aureus (Wei G et al 2009 JBC 284: 29180-92), implying membrane targeting.SAR:  Being more hydrophobic, more active against bacteria than HNP 1-3.  HNP-4 showed higher anti-HIV activity than HNP-1, HNP-2 or HNP-3 (Wu Z et al. 2005 FEBS Lett 579: 162-166).  An alanine scanning  was conducted for 24 residues. Different from HNP1-3, HNP4 preferentially kills the Gram-negative bacterium, probabbly due to a cluster of arginines Arg10, Arg11 and Arg15.  This cationic cluster of HNP4 is also important for HNP4 killing of S. aureus, inhibition of anthrax lethal factor  (LF) and binding to LF and gp120. In addition, N-methylation of Leu20 to destabilize the HNP4 dimer had little effect on E. coli killing, but significantly reduced the ability of HNP4 to kill S. aureus, inhibit LF, and bind to LF and gp120 (Hu et al., 2019).Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: the peptide has been expressed. and purified for structural determination.Updated Jan2012; Jan2019; 2/2025 GW.",
