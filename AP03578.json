  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (87.5%) toMDN-0066L:50%.Chemical modification: C-terminal carboxylic acid forms an ester bond with the side chain Oh of T3. C10 fatty acid CHAIN to L1. In addition, E2, allo-T3, L4, L5, and S6 are D-amino acids. The incorporation of valine at position 8 may be due to the richness of valine in the medium.Activity: paper-disc agar diffusion assay: Both active against S. aureus CMCC26003 (MIC 2.5 ug/disc), B-subtilis CMCC63501 (MIC >25 ug/disc), and E. coli CMCC44102 (2.5 ug/disc), P-aeruginosa CMCC10104 (MIC >25 ug/disc), and fungus C-albicans CMCC98001 (MIC >25 ug/disc).
