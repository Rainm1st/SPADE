    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: 90% similar to Cathelicidin-BF (BF-30) (AP01239). K: 33%; F: 17%; V: 10%. M Wt: 3595.48; GRAVY: -0.51.Activity: Active against E. coli ATCC 25922 or ML-35p or 6 clincal strains (MIC 1.56-12.5 ug/ml), E. cloacae (MIC 3.1-25 ug/ml), E. aerogenes (MIC 6.25 ug/ml),  4 P. aeruginosa strains (MIC 6.25-12.5 ug/ml), H. influenzae (MIC 3.1 ug/ml), K. pneumoniae (MIC 3.1-6.2 ug/ml), Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 25923 or ATCC 43300 MRSA (MIC 3.125-6.25 ug/ml), E. faecalis ATCC 29212 (MIC 25 ug/ml), and fungi C.albicans (MIC >200 ug/ml).MOA:bacteria: Similar activity of D=L forms indicates membrane targeting.Toxicity: not hemo.lytic (HC50 >> 400 ug/ml); HaCaT cell line (LC50> 200 ug/ml). mice: LD50 120 mg/kg i.p. or s.c. Both OH-CATH30 and OH-CM6 displayed in vivo efficacy in reducing drug-resistant E. coli burdens in the neutropenic thigh infection animal model:mouse or murine bacteremia model. It also showed protective effects on E. coli induced rabbit urinary tract infection models (animal model:rabbit:bacteria)(Zhang et al., 2013). The D-form of these peptides is also active in vivo although with higher cytotoxicity (Li SA et al. 2010). In addition, topical application of OH-CATH30 is efficacious against drug-resistant P. aeruginosa keratitis (Li SA et al., 2014).  This peptide also inhibits Escherichia coli ATP synthase (Azim et al., 2016).",
