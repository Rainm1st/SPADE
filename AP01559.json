    "Literature": "Activity: Inhibition zone: Inhibited A. niger (11 mm), F. solani (15 mm), and F. oxysporum (12 mm) using 50 ul of 200 ug/ml. This basic, Cys-rich antifungal peptide is also active against bacteria, including S. aureus (11-19 mm), B. cereus (15-22 mm), M. luteus (12-18 mm), E. faecalis (10-13 mm), E. coli (12-16 mm), P. aeruginosa and K.pneumonia (0 mm) treated at 50 to 200 ug/ml.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: it has been expressed. Another lab also expressed it in E. coli (Zamani et al., 2021).Peptide stability:  can be cleaved by trypsin, chymotrypsin, Pepsin, Proteinase K, and Alcalase (0 mm inhibition against B. cereus, cf. 22 mm without enzyme). Heat-stable, activity remained after 15 min incubation at 100oC.Antimicrobial robustness: pH-senstive at acidic (3-5) or high (pH 11) but NOT between pH 6-10. Updated 4/2024",
