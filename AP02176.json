  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Active against S. aureus (MIC 25-32 mg/L),   E. faecalis ATCC 29212 (MIC 100 uM), and C.albicans (MIC 128 mg/L). Also discovered in Phyllomedusa sauvagii (Raja et al., 2013). It appeared to be specifically active against S. aureus because it showed no activity against other Gram+, Gram-, yeasts, and parasites (MIC >100 uM, or IC50 NA).Toxicity: Essentially no hemolysis at 128 ug/ml (HC50 >512 ug/ml), poor hemolytic. Found in multiple species. UPdated 7/2020; 7/2021",
