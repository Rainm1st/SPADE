    "Literature": "Molecular form: Shown in chain alpha and the sequence of chain beta is GDPEARSGIPCTIGAAVAASIAVCPTTKCSKRCGKRKK. It shows sequence homology to another two two-chain lantibiotics: lacticin 3147 and staphylococcin C55.Activity: Both chains have inherent activitiesSynergy:AMPs:  but work best and synergistically at a 1:1 ratio.SAR:  The oxidation state of the two Cys residues appear not to be essential for activity.",
