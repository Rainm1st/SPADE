  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Diffusion assays (20 ug peptide): Active against B. subtilis (inhibition diameter: 19.04 mm),  X. campestris pv. Vesicatoria (16.47 mm), P. solanacearum (10.75 mm), P. wickerhami (10.3 mm), B. megaterium (7.3 mm). Active against fungi: P. capsici (23.06% inhibition), V. dahliae (52.46% inhibition), F. graminearum (23.94% inhibition), and F. omysporum (14.6% inhibition).  Interstingly, the same peptide has also been identified in Lactobacillus crustorum MN047 (Yi et al., 2018). Inhibition zone assays reveal broad-spectrum activity. active against Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 29213, 25923 (19.1-19.2 mm), E. faecalis ATCC 29212 (10.3 mm), L. monocytogenes CMCC 54004 (17.2 mm),  Gram- E. coli ATCC 25922 (17.0 mm), Salmonella CMCC 50071 (18.7 mm), C. sakazakii ATCC 29544 (18 mm), also active against antibiotic0resistant C. sakazakii (16.9-18.4 mm) and Salmonella 557D (15.6 mm). Found in multiple species. Updated 7/2021",
