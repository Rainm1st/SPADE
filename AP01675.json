    "Literature": "AMPs and human disease: amyloid AMPs: The deposition of beta-amyloid peptides in human brains is believed to be related to Alzheimer's disease.Activity:The discovery of antimicrobial property of this peptide adds a new avenue to understanding the mechanism of the Alzhermer's disease. It also inhibits  Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) (Bourgade K et al., 2014). Although less effective than the 42mer, it also inhibits influenza A virus (White et al. 2014).Synergy:AMPs: It appears to show synergistic effects with magainin 2 in vitro.Updated 11/2014; 3/2018; 3/2020",
