    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE most resembles (80.7% similarity)Suicin 65.Activity: Active against L. lactis BGBM50. This production of this novel bacteriocin by L. lactis LMG2081 explains susceptibility of L. lactis BGBM50.Chemical modification: The caculated mol. wt (2834) differs from that measured by MS (2759), implying post-translational modifications. Three thioether bridges are predicted: 7-12, 9-23, and 16-24. Residue T22 is a dehydrobutyrine. Updated 7/2021",
