    "Literature": "Active against Gram+ Bacillus sp. DM-1, M. luteus, B. megaterium (MIC 0.25-0.6 uM), Gram- bacteria A. tumerfaciens, E. coli, S. oneidensis, Stenotrophomonus sp. YC-1 (MIC 1.5-6 uM), S. typhimurium(MIC 10.9 uM), fungi A. fumigatus, Beauveria spp., G. candidum, N. crassa (MIC 1.9-8.3 uM), S. cerevisiae (MIC 10.9 uM), and C. albicans (MIC 25.1 uM). Overall, it is slightly more active than meucin-13.Toxicity: It is highly hemolytic to rabbit red blood cells (90% lysis at 12.5 uM). Also strongly hemolytic to pig RBC at 25 uM (see the ref for AP3346). Updated 5/2015; 7/2021",
