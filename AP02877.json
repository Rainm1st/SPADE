  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Active against S. aureus (MIC 0.06 ug/ml), MRSA (MIC 0.96 ug/ml), and VISA (MIC 3.82 ug/ml) (provided by Chunfeng Wang).Chemical modification:  NMR played a critical role in establishing the peptide primary structure. While the N-terminal residue is an N,N-dimethyl Ile (DmIle), the C-terminus is a N2,N2-dimethyl-1,2-propanediamine (Dmp). In addition, threonines are dehydrated into Dhb. In this sense, this peptide may be classified as a class I variant bacteriocin.Surface immobilized peptide: TBA? ref?",
