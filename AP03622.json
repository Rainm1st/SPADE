    "Literature": "Discovery: The same sequence was initially reported in a different frog without activty data (see AP2384). In the current study, the peptide is isolated, sequenced and charaterized.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (82.76%) toRaniseptin 1V=L: 14%; K: 18%; G: 11%. GRAVY: 0.3; M Wt: 2960.586; Mol formula:  C137H238N35O35; molar extinction coeff: 5550.Activity: Gram- E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 2 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883 (MIC 1 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883 (MIC 4 uM), Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC 4 uM), S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC 8 uM), and yeast C.albicans ATCC 14053 (MIC > 128 uM).Toxicity: hRBC, low hemo.lytic (20% heolysis at 128 uM; HC50 >128 uM). Toxic to  murine skin melanoma B16F10 cells (IC50 6.56 uM) and NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts  cells (IC50 4.21 uM).Structure: random coil in water and helical in 35 mM SDS.Found in multiple species.",
