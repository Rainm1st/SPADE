  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: purified chromatographically. initially reported as a protease inhibitor (Kimura et al., 1997).Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is poorly similar (36.84%) tobuCATHL4A.Chemical modification: there is a unique aamide bond between N-terminus NH of S1 and the sidechain of D9.Activity: inhibition zone: weakly active against P. aeruginosa (10.6 mm), M. phlei IFO 3158 (14.5 mm), and X. oryzae IFO 3312 (11.5 mm). It also inhibited prolyl endopeptidase (Ki 0.7 uM).SAR: Propeptin-2, with two C-terminal residues deleted from propeptin, lost its activity agains this bacterial strain (Kimura et al., 2007).",
