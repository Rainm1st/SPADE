    "Literature": "Active against E. coli ATCC25922 (MIC 60 ug/ml), S. aureus ATCC2592 (15 ug/ml), B.subtilis ATCC 6633 (120 ug/ml), H. pylori NCTC11637 (MIC 30 ug/ml), and C. albicans ATCC2002 (MIC 30 ug/ml). Members of the new peptide family named pleurain-As are composed of 26 amino acids with a unique N-terminal sequence (SIIT) and a disulfide-bridged heptapeptide sequence (CRLYNTC). Notably, pleurain-As could exert antimicrobial capability against H. pylori. Also reported byYang H et al (2009)as antioxidant peptides.Toxicity: it showed little hemolytic activity till 200 ug/ml.
