    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (60%) toCg-bigdef1A: 12%. GRAVY: -0.22; M Wt: 9984.49; Mol formula:  C451H675N121O120S7; molar extinction coeff: 34495.Chemical modification: the C-terminus is amidated. In addition, three disulfide bonds are formed: C1-C5, C2-C4, and C3-C6.Activity: active against Alcanivorax sp. 15.5817 (MIC >10 uM), Alteromonas sp. 15.5805 (MIC 2.5 uM), Aquimarina sp. LTB 128 (MIC 2.5 uM), Bacillus sp. 15.5814 (MIC 1.25 uM), Halomonas sp. 15.5829 (MIC >10 uM), Marinobacterium sp. 05.091-3T1 (MIC 2.5 uM), Marinomonas sp. 14.063 (MIC 0.6 uM), Marinomonas sp. 15.5827 (MIC >10 uM), Martellela sp. 15.5818 (MIC 1.25 uM), Pseudoalteromonas sp. 15.5809 (MIC >10 uM), Ruegeria sp. 15.5815 (MIC 10 uM), Shewanella sp. 15.5830 (MIC 10 uM), Sulfitobacter sp. 12.141-5T2 (MIC 2.5 uM), Tenacibaculum sp. 08.072-4T6 (MIC >10 uM), and Winogradskyella sp. 08.27-4T1 (MIC >10 uM). The activity appears to be complementary to Cg-BigDef1, indicating the necessity of AMP diversification.Synergy:AMPs: in addition, it showed strong synergy with Cg-BigDef1 against the Gram-positive Bacillus sp. 15.5814 with an FIC value of 0.35.Antimicrobial robustness: salt-insensitive: antimicrobial assays were tested at 400 mM NaCl (physiological condition).
