  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: poorly active against S.aureus (MIC 120 uM), P.aeruginosa (MIC 164 uM), and E.coli 240 uM (ref. see AP1640), A. baumannii (3.1-6.2 uM). Agelaia-MPI showed adhesion inhibition for isolates AB 02 at a concentration of 25 uM while isolates AB 53 and AB 72 were inhibited at a concentration of 6.25 and 12.5 uM,\nrespectively (das Neves RC et al. 2019).In vitro toxicity: human RBC: HC50 3.7 uM; rat RBC: HC50 7.0 uM. highly hemolytic (Ye et al., 2023). Agelaia-MP was characterized as a hemolytic, mast cell degranulator toxin, presenting a poor antimicrobial action and no chemotaxis for PMNL. This peptide promotes insulin secretion in mice pancreatic islets (Baptista-Saidemberg et al., 2012), thereby of interest for type 2 diabetes (T2D).The original Dhvar5 has been replaced 9/30/10; update Jan2017; 5/2017; 4/2019; 7/2021; 7/2024.",
