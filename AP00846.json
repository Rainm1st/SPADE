    "Literature": "Active against E. faecium IFO13712, E. faecalis IFO12964, E. mundtii JCM 8731T (+++), L. plantarum ATCC 8041, L. lactis NFRI 7307, L. curvatus JCM 1096 (+), L. monocytogenes ATCC 15313 or ATCC 49594 (++). Note that mundticin KS (this entry) and mundticin ATO6 (APD entry 631) are distinguished by the inversion of the last two amino acids at their respective C termini. These two mundticins were expressed in Escherichia coli as recombinant peptides and found to be different in activity against certain Lactobacillus strains, such as L. plantarum and L. curvatus.
