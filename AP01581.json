Also, active against L. infantum, L. major,  L. braziliensis (IC50 12.6-16.5 uM) (also refer toRaja et al., 2013), and L. amazonensis inside infected macrophages (KÃ¼ckelhaus et al., 2020).  Only a low level of hemolytic activity (6.7% at 5 uM) was observed.  hemolytic LC50 39 uM. Remarkably, PSN-1 displayed a Minimal biofilm eradication concentration MBEC (peg lids used) against the 24h S. aureus biofilm at 5uM idetical to the MIC. Updated 5/2015; 7/2020; 6/2023.",
