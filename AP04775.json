    "Literature": "Peptide discovery: A synthetic peptide from the first genome predicted cathelicidin.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence shows similarity (78.79%) toanother predicted CATHPb1K: 36%, F: 21%, I=R: 14%. Note that CATHpb1 is temporarily assigned as \"Natural\" until the naive one has been isolated.Activity: Active against Gram- E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 2 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 3 ug/ml), S. typhimurium ATCC 14028 (MIC 1.5 ug/ml), Gram+ S.aureus ATCC 29213 (MIC >128 ug/ml), B. cereus ATCC 10876 (MIC 46 ug/ml).In vitro toxicity: chicken RBC, 12.2% hemolysis at 64 ug/ml. concentration-dependent.",
