    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals 52.6% similar to AP01477Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)Activity: Active against E. coli (MIC 28.3 uM), S.aureus (MIC >30 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 1.2 uM), and B. cereus (MIC 23.3) (see ref). Another study (PMID:30462698): Active against B. cenocepacia (J2315) (MIC 10 ug/ml), A. pleuropneumoniae (MIC 7.5 ug/ml), B. subtilis (PY79) (MIC 28 ug/ml), B. velezensis (MIC 76 ug/ml), B. amyloliquefaciens (MIC 42 ug/ml), inactive against P.putida (KT2440) (MIC 113 ug/ml), P.fluorescens (MF37), E.coli (JM109), B.thailendensis (ATCC700388), S.marcescens (ATCC14756), B.cereus (ATCC11778), S.aureus (ATCC6538#P), S.aureus (Newman) (MIC >200 ug/ml). A third study (PMID: 33372152): kill E. coli 43889, S. aureus USA300, and P. aeruginosa PAO1 (MBC 2- 10 uM). MBC (>3 log CFU reduction) was measured by incubating bacteria for 1 h followed by plating. Radial diffusion assays revealed activity against MDR strains: S. aureus USA300, A. baumannii HUMC-1, C. albicans CA36082S, and S. typhimurium ST 5996S.Host expression:  PACAP is induced in brain up to 40-50 fold and in kidney by 80-100 fold in response to S. aureus and C. albicans.
