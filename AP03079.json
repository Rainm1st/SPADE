    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 41.6% similarity tosC. coturnix cathelicidin.Activity: Active against E. coli ATCC25922 and clinical strains (MIC 4.69-9.38 ug/mL),  S. dysenteriae (MIC 1.17 ug/ml),  K. Pneumoniae (MIC 9.38-18.75 ug/ml), S. maltophilia (MIC 18.7 ug/ml), K. oxytoca (MIC 18.75 ug/ml), P. vulgaris (MIC 18.75 ug/ml), P. mirabilis (MIC 18.75 ug/ml), A. baumannii (MIC 18.75 ug/ml), S. maltophilia (MIC 18.75 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa (MIC 2.3-9.3 (MIC 18.75 ug/ml), S. aureus clinical strains (MIC 4.69-9.38 (MIC 18.75 ug/ml), B. cereus (MIC 9.38 (MIC 18.75 ug/ml), B. subtilis (MIC 4.69 (MIC 18.75 ug/ml), E. faecium (MIC 2.34 ug/ml),  N. asteroides (MIC 2.34 ug/ml), E. faecalis (MIC 75 ug/ml), S. epidermidis (MIC 9.38 ug/mL), fungi C. albicans (MIC 9.38 ug/ml), C. neoformans (18.75 ug/ml), aquatic pathogens V. brasiliensis (MIC 18.7 ug/ml), V. cholerae (18.7 ug/ml), A. veronii (MIC 9.3 ug/ml), and  E. tarda (MIC 18.7 ug/ml). In a separate study, this peptide also showed good activity against aquatic bacteria Gram- V. alginolyticus (MIC 4.58 uM), V. anguillarum, V. brasiliensis (MIC 1.15 uM), V. cholerae (MIC 0.57 uM), V. fluvialis (MIC 1.15 uM), V. harveyi (MIC 1.15 uM),  V. parahaemolyticus (MIC 0.57 uM),  V. splendidus (MIC 1.15 uM),  V. vulnificus. (MIC 4.58 uM), A. hydrophila (MIC 1.15 uM), A. sobria (MIC 2.29 uM),  A.veronii (MIC 2.29 uM), and N. asteroides (MIC 1.15 uM) (Ouyang et al., 2022).Toxicity:  10% hemolysis at 100 uM. 5 ug/ml Cm-CATHs significantly reduced the LPS-induced production of cytokines, including NO, pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6), anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and chemokine MCP-1. It also shows antibiofilm activity and anti-inflammatory activity.In vivo toxicity: At 200 uM, it caused 15.5% and 27.8% death of fish cells EPC and FHM, respectively.
