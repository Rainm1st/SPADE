  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE shows 19.7% similarity toMrCrs. Active primarily against Gram-positive S. aureus (MIC 2.5-10 uM), M. luteus (MIC 20-50 uM), and Gram-negative bacteria, E. coli 363 (MIC 50-80 uM).  The peptide is helical based on CD studies (Arayamethakorn S et al., 2016).",
