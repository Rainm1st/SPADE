    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 91.7% similarity toDermaseptin-B6Mol Wt:  2550.978; GRAVY: -0.052. 17% A and 13% K.Structure:  Helical in 50% TFE.Activity: Active against E. coli NCTC 10418 (MIC 32 uM) and C. albicans NCYC 1467 (MIC 64 uM). Inactive: S.aureus NCTC 10788 (MIC 256 uM).SAR: Peptide antibacterial activity was increased substantially for K5,K17-DPS (MIC 4-8 uM) and L10,L11-DPS3 (MIC 8-16 uM). Unfavorably, this is also accompanied by an increase in hemo-lytic activity. DPS3 is also toxic to human cancer cells H157 (IC50 15.67 uM) and PC3 (IC50 18.2 uM) but not normal HMEC-1 cells (IC50 132 uM) and RBCs (HC50 = 138 uM). Updated Jan2020; 7/2021",
