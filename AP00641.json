  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "The C-terminal region is important for peptide oligomerization. Deletion of the C-terminal 11 residues retained its antibacterial activity but reduced hemolytic activity (Oren and Shai 1996 Eur J Biochem 237:303-310). Pardaxin tends to form a pore in zwitterionic membranes, consistent with oligomer formation.  However, it lyzes anionic lipid vesicle by binding to the interfacial head group region of anionic PGs (Vad et al. 2010 Biophys J 98: 576-85). It appears that the mechanism of action (MOA) for a particular AMP can be membrane or cell dependent.  APD update 9/28/2012.",
