    "Literature": "A peptide isolated from a fossil plant. Only the N-terminal sequence of this 13 kDa protein  is reported. Active against B. cinerea, M. arachidicola, F. oxysporum, R. solani, and C. comatus. MOA: Ginkbilobin can activate actin-dependent cell death of fungi (Gao N et al., 2015). Moderate activity against bacteria S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli. It also has inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase  activity and the proliferation of reverse transcriptase. Updated 3/2016.",
