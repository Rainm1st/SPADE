  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "There are two cysteine-derived thiazole groups. This peptide is not secreted. T. erythraeum crude methanolic extracts were tested for general cytotoxicity (HCT-116 at 10 ug/ml and CEM-TART at 5 and 50 ug/ml) and anti-human immunodeficiency virus (1 and 10 ug/ml), antifungal (Candida albicans at 10 ug/ml), or antimicrobial (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium at 10 ug/ml) effects. No significant activity was found in these assays (data not shown). To be replaced.",
