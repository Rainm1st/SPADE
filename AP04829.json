    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (39.13%) toBrevinin-2EAC: 15%; G: 13%. GRAVY: 0.07; mol Wt: 4380.086; mol formula: C182H285N51O57S8; mol ex coeff: 14455. This is a unique peptide sequence.Chemical modification:  three disulfide bonds: 1-4, 2-5, 3-6.Activity: insecticidal (LD50 51.7 nmol/g), 294 nmol/g killed all D. melanogaster in 2 h.Structure:  determined using 454 distance restrainst and 74 dihedral angles. It consists of 3 beta strands and two 3-10 helices.You can rotate, zoom, and view the structureherein the PDB.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: solid-phasesynthesis was not successful. This recombinant form has one extra glycine at the N-terminus (rPp19). However, rPp19 co-eluated with the natural form on HPLC. Expressed as a maltose binding protein (MBP) fusion protein with a His-tag for Ni2+ affinity purification, g tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage, further purified via RP-HPLC.",
