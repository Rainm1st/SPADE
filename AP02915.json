    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide shows 45.6% similarity toArasin-likeSp.  Molecular formula:  C211H323N56O52S4; Mol Wt  4629.49.    GRAVY= -0.34; Wimley-White whole-residue hydrophobicity of the peptide:  3.22  kcal/mol, and PI 8.92.Activity:  Active against Gram+ S. aureus AS1.89 (MIC 12.5 uM), M. luteus SDMCC210058 (MIC 6.25 uM), Gram- A. hydrohila (MIC 25 uM), E. coli DH5alpha (MIC 12.5 uM), and V. anguillarum SDMCC210204 (MIC 6.25 uM). The N-terminal Pro-rich domain is proposed to be essential for activity. Updated 7/2021",
