  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: derived from the N-terminal region of histone H1. Purified chromatographically. A 26-mer was initially found in 2001 (Patrzykat et al., 2001) but was inactive probably due to a lack of proline isomerase actiion (see activity section).Chemical modification:  N-terminal acetylation (XXE).Activity: synthetic peptide became active after column treatment with peptidylproline cis-trans-isomerase. Thus, isomerization of the proline peptide bond(s) was necessary for activation of the synthetic peptide. Purified and activated peptides showed the same activity. Active against Gram- E. coli (MIC 2 uM), A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida (MIC 4 uM), V. anguillarum (MIC 1 uM), S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (MIC 4 uM), Gram+ B. subtilis (MIC 2 uM), and L. ivanovii (MIC 4 uM).Structure: the active form, both the natural and the synthetic forms, is more structured, condensed, and rigid than the inactive form (CD).Updated 7/2021; 11/2023",
