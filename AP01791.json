    "Literature": "Chemical modification: C-terminal amidation.Activity: Active against S. aureus AB94004 MRSA (MIC 5-32 ug/ml), B. thuringiensis AB92037 (MIC 10 ug/ml), B. subtilis AB91021 (MIC 10 ug/ml), M. luteus AB93113 (MIC 5 ug/ml), and C. albicans AY93025 (MIC 20 ug/ml). In particular, it is active against clinical isolates MRSA, penicillin-resistant S. epidermidis at 10 ug/ml. active against E. faecium ATCC29212 (MIC 64 ug/ml), A. baumannii ATCC19606 (MIC 16 ug/ml). However, the peptide is inactive against E.coli or P.aeruginosa (>100 ug/ml).MOA:bacteria: The peptide showed a rapid killing probably tarrgeting bacterial membranes.Structure: In 30% or 70% TFE, it adopted a helical structure based on CD. Detailed 3D structures of Ctriporin in micelles have been determined by NMR (Bandyopadhyay S et al., 2014). Of note, the structure in complex with SDS differs from that in DPC. It was proposed that such differences might explain peptide selectivity.Animal model:mouse:  topical treatment could cure skin infection. Updated 12/2014; 7/2021; 10/2023; 6/2024 GW.",
