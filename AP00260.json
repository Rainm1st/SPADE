    "Literature": "Sequence analysis:  A: 24%; V: 19%. GRAVY: 1.3.Chemical modification: C-terminal NH2.Activity: Activity against B. cereus (MIC 50 ug/ml), L. lactis (MIC 3 ug/ml), L. innocua (MIC 100 ug/ml), M. luteus (MIC 12 ug/ml), P. multocida (MIC 50 ug/ml), S. aureus (MIC 6-12 ug/ml), S. uberis (MIC 3 ug/ml), S. epidermidis (MIC 12 ug/ml), S. faecalis (MIC 25 ug/ml), E.coli (MIC >100 ug/ml).Also, this peptide could inhibit HIV infection with little adverse effect on T cells (J Virol 2005; 79:11598-11606).Structure:  3D structure was determined in TFE or DPC (Chia BCS et al 2000 Eur J Biochem 267: 1894-1908). The peptide also adopts a helical structure in bicelles. In micelles, it seems that the N-terminus is more exposed to the solvent than the C-terminus. Of note is that this peptide appears to adopt a transmemrbane orientation in lipid bilayer, implying pore formation (Anton P Le Brun et al., 2020).SAR:  d-Maculatin 1.1: the same sequence made of D-amino acids (except G) showed essentially the same activity as the WT made of L-amino acids (D=L), indicating membrane targeting. Maculatin 1.1 acid: This peptide made without C-terminal amidation lost activity against most of the bacteria with MIC > 100 ug/ml except for L. lactic (MIC 50 ug/ml).Updated 12/2010; 4/2019; 7/2020; 7/2021; 12/2024",
