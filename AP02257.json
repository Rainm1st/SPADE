    "Literature": "Founding AMP: Both Professors Robert Lehrer and Richard Gallo pointed at lysozyme as the first antimicrobial peptide (seeAMP discovery timeline). And the classic paper in the ref is recommended by Dr. Gallo as the beginning (birth) of modern innate immunity.SAR: The structure and activity relationship of human lysozyme can be found in modern Biochemistry textbooks. It catalytically hydrolyzes bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan and has also been\nshown to exert catalysis-independent antimicrobial properties, thereby active against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. primary bactericidin in human plasma serum active against B. subtilis (Selsted and Martinez, 1978).Structure:You can rotate, zoom, and view the crystal structureherein the PDB.Synergy:AMPs: It showed synergistic effect with LL-37(Abou Aliwa et al., 2014).Pathogen infection strategy:  Mycobacterium tuberculosis uses a novel glycosylated and surface-localized lipoprotein, LprI, to abrogate the lytic activity of lysozyme(Sethi D eta l., 2016).AMPs in use: food preservation: lysozyme is used as Japan's most trusted preservative for fruits, vegetables, and food (https://www.bioseutica.com/products/lysozyme).
