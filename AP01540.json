  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "The peptide only kills bacteria at acidic pH. It is an anionic peptide, which does not associate with surfactant lipids at neutral pH, thereby avoiding being sequested in the airspaces. Remarkably, a SP-B-mimicking peptide, KL4, seq KLLLLKLLLLKLLLLKLLLLK, showed the greatest clinical success for treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (Long JR et al 2010 BBA 1798:216-22).",
