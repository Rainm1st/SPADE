  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "CRAMP-1 was prepared based on the predicted elastase cleavage site at position 138â€“139 and is a 33-amino acid peptide.Activity: Active against E. coli ATCC 25922 or ML35 or D21 (MIC 0.5-2 uM), S. typhimurium ATCC 14028 (MIC 8 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 4 uM), S. marcescens ATCC 8100 (MIC 4 uM), P-vulgaris ATCC 13315 (MIC>64 uM), S. aureus ATCC 25923 or Cowan I MRSA (MIC 32-64 uM), S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC 16 uM), S. faecalis ATCC 29212 (MIC 32 uM), B. megaterium Bm11 (MIC 4 uM), fumgi C-albicans (MIC > 64 uM), C. neoformans (MIC 16 uM), and the single-stranded RNA virus respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). It also inhibit B. anthracis (MIC 8 ug/ml) (Blower et al., 2018). IL-17A and IL-17F are essential for the production of CRAMP to clear S. aureus nasal colonization (Archer NK et al., 2016).SAR: CRAMP 18 is a fragment of CRAMP from G16 to L33 and retains antibacterial activityShin SY et al., 2000.Toxicity: CRAMP is also anticancer (tumor cells A549, K562, Jurkat, IC50 16-28 uM) with 2.2% hemolysis at 100 uM (little hemo.lytic). Change residue 2, 9, or 13 to K made CRAMP-18 anticancer as well but not better than its parent molecule. CRAMP also inactivates Zika virus (ZIKV).
