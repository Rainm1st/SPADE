  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Like other gamma-thionins,this peptide contains 4 S-S bonds. Different from other gamma-thionins, it was proposed to have 48 residues ending at Trp48. However, fluorescence assays did not detect the Trp residue, suggesting that this amino acid is missing in the sequence (Nitti et al 1995 Eur J Biochem 228: 250-256). Thus, Trp48 is not included in the sequence.",
