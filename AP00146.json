  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Active against E. coli W 160-37 (MIC 5-10 ug/ml), S. aureus 8530B (MIC 10-15 ug/ml), B. subtilis (MIC 2-4 ug/ml), and P. putida NCIM 2102 (MIC 25-35 ug/ml) (ref AP252). Also Active against Gram+ B. megaterium Bm11 (LD=Lethal conc. 0.6 uM), S. aureus Cowan I,  E. coli, Y. pseudotuberculosis YPIII, P. aeruginosa ATCC15692, A.hydrophila Bo-3N (NA), and E. agglomerans Bo-1S (LD 0.2-2.8 uM) (Ref. AP83). ActivityG: D=L. Also active against colistin-resistant A. baumannii.   C. albicans (MIC 3-6 uM) (ref, see AP2411) and  HSV-1, HSV-2 (Yasin et al., 2000). It is also insecticidal (EC50 5.9 pmol/mg fly). Active against Gram+ bacteria S. mutants (MIC 1.1 uM), S. aureus (MIC 4.4 uM), and E. faecium (MIC 2.2 uM) and gram- bacteria E. coli O-157 (MIC 1.1 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 2.2 uM), and V. vulnificus (MIC 4.4 uM) and fungi C. albicans (MIC 8.8 uM), T. beigelii (MIC 4.4 uM), M. furfur (MIC 8.8 uM) (see ref. AP1480).  A similar sequence was reported to be active against L. panamensis (Perez-Cordero JJ et al. 2011 Peptides 32, 683-90).Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-insensitive:E. coli (150 mM), KCl-insensitive:E. coli (4.5 mM), NH4Cl-insensitive:E. coli (6 uM), MgCl2-insensitive:E. coli (1 mM), CaCl2-sensitive:E. coli (2.5 mM);   NaCl-insensitive:S. aureus (150 mM), KCl-insensitive:S. aureus (4.5 mM), NH4Cl-insensitive:S. aureus (6 uM), MgCl2-insensitive:S. aureus (1 mM), CaCl2-sensitive:S. aureus (2.5 mM) (ref, see AP5069).Structure: It forms a tetramer at high peptide concentrations or high salt concentrations in the crystal.  Melittin contains a helical structure (residues 2-25) with a bend between residues 11-15 (Kreil, 1973).You can rotate, zoom, and view the tetrameric crystal structureherein the PDB. Warning:  this structure may not represent the membrane-bound form.SAR: A P14A mutation removed the bend but became 2.5-fold more hemolytic.MOA:fungi: Melittin hinders fungal growth (numerous strains, see the ref) by several mechanisms such as membrane permeabilization, apoptosis induction by reactive oxygen species-mediated mitochondria/caspase-dependent pathway, inhibition of (1,3)-beta-D-glucan synthase, and alterations in fungal gene expression (Memariani and Memariani, 2020).MOA:virus: It inhibits HIV by suppressing viral gene expression (J Gen Virol 1998; 79:731-40).Found in multiple species.Toxicity:  It is highly hemolytic (100% at 6.25 uM) and can cause histamine releasing (85% at 10 uM) (Kawakami et al., 2017).Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli:a GST fusion:yield: 3.5 mg/L (Zhou et al., 2020).Chemical modification: Succinyl bee venom melittin is a leukocyte chemotactic factor (Wilkinson, 1977). N-terminal succinylation (+ charge to - conversion) enhanced peptide aggregation in solution (Stankowski  et al., 1991).Updated 2/2014; 6/2014; 3/2015; 5/2017; 6/2018; Jan2020; 6/2020; 12/2022; 12/2024; Jan2025 GW.",
