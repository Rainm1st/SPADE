  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "This is the first noncyclized plant cyclotide. It is less hydrophobic than cyclic cyclotides as relfected by early elution from the HPLC column. Thus, it was shown to be less hemolytic than cyclotides.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. Like cyclotides, this open-ended structure remains stable to select proteases.
