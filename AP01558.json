  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Constitutively expressed in circulating NK cells. Active against Gram-negative bacteria such as V. alginolyticus and gram-positive bacteria such as M. luteus, S. aureus, including MRSA. Bromotryptophans (probably at position 6 of the aromatic ring) are found in the peptide. Synthetic unbrominated peptides are as active as the modified natural form, indicating bromination is not critical for antimicrobial activity. It may, however, improve peptide stability to proteases (this ref).Structure: A helix-turn-helix structure (helix1: 5-8; helix 2:13-17) of hedistin in DPC micelles was reported by Xu et al (2009 Biochim Biophys Acta 1788: 2497-2508).",
