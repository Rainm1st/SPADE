  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE most resembles (53.8%)Ls-Stylicin1. 18 prolines at the N-terminal domain and 13 Cys at the C-terminus. It is expressed in all tissues: highest in gills and hemocytes. Mj-sty is potentially involved in the ontogenesis and immune responses to white spot syndrome virus (WSSV).",
