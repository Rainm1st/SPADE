    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (93.33%) toBrevinin-2GUbIt is also 93.33% similar to Brevinin-2GHb (AP00583). This entry differs from the other two known brevinins in the APD by only one residue in each case (residue 4: I vs. T in the former and residue 6: A vs. T in the latter). GRAVY: 0.21; Mol formula:  C135H239N39O41S2; M. Wt: 3141.74, and Mol ex coeff.: 125.Activity:  Active against Gram- E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 47.78 uM), P.aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC>100 uM), Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC 47.78 uM), P. acnes ATCC 6919 (MIC 14.93 uM), B. subtilis CMCC 63501 (MIC 4.97 uM), and fungi C. albicans ATCC 10231 (MIC 59.73 uM). It also suppresses the LPS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory NO, MCP-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha.Structure: Helical in complex with SDS micelles.In vitro toxicity:  low (1.4%) hemo.lysis at 100 uM to murine RBC.
