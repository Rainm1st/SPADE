    "Literature": "Host expression: After bacteria challenge, it is highly expressed in trachea, muscle, and fat body.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence  is 73.2% similar tofly defensin.Activity: Active against MRSA; S. aureus 40881, 12256 or CVCC 546 (MIC 3.75 uM), S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC 14.99 uM), S. pneumoniae CVCC 2350 (MIC 7.5 uM), S. suis CVCC 3928 (MIC 3.75 uM), and B. subtilis (MIC 0.02-0.04 uM). Not active against G- bacteria tested E.coli CVCC1515 (MIC >128 ug/ml; ~30 uM), E.coli CICC21530 (serotype O157:H7), S.typhimurium ATCC14028, S.enteritidis CMCC50336 (MIC >128 ug/ml). Activity also fromLi (et al., 2020).Recombinant production:bacteria: It has been recombinantly expressed in bacteria (Jiang et al., 2022).Animal model:mouse:Li et al. 2017showed that DLP4 can protect mice from MRSA infection at 3-7.5 mg/kg. Activity data for DLP1 and DLP3 are not yet available. Updated 9/2017; 7/2021; 7/2022; 10/2023",
