    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (85.71%) toDermaseptin-B3L=A=K: 19%; G: 15%. GRAVY: 0.638; mol Wt: 2653.3; mol formula: C123H215N32O30S1; mol ex coeff: 5550.Chemical modification:   Reduction of disulfide bonds and alkylation of cysteines indicate that disulfide bonds are important for peptide stability rather than activity.Activity: active against S. aureus NCTC 10788or MRSA NCTC 12493 (MIC 2 uM), E. faecalis NCTC 1269 (MIC 4 uM),  E. coli NCTC 10418(MIC 2 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 2 uM),  K. pneumoniae ATCC 43816 (MIC 1 uM) and C. albicans CYC 1467 (MIC 1 uM). Assays used 1 ul peptide/99 ul MHB culture.Inhibited cancer cells H157 (IC50 1.55 uM), MCF-7 (IC50 2.92 uM), PC-3 (IC50 4.15 uM), and U251 MG cells (IC50 2.47 uM).In vitro toxicity: horse RBC: HC50 38.77 uM.  Induced a very low degree of LDH release in normal HMEC-1 cells (<10%).Structure:  helical in 50% TFE.Peptide formulation: Animal model:mouse; wound healing model:S. aureus, formulated with polytannic acid (pTA)-coated PLGA nanoparticles could eliminate 99% E. coli and S. aureus in an irradiation controlled release manner (Guo et al., 2024).  Promoted angiogenesis and reduced inflammation.Animal model:cancer:mouse:  subcutaneous H157 tumor model: cancer cells injected into the right underarm to develop advanced tumor for 14 days. Treatment: daily intratumoral injections for 10 days, control treated with Cisplatin for 5 days IP. Sacrified day 11. Inhibited tumore growth in nude mice in a dose-dependent manner (tumor size reduced) without obviouss side effects. pH sensitive liposome formulation reduced toxicity and enhanced anticancer activity (Wang et al., 2023).MOA:cancer: Dermaseptin-PP Induced H157 Cell Apoptosis Through an Endogenous Mitochondrial Death Pathway.",
