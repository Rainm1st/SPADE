  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Most similar (94.7%) to Tricholongin BI, differing only at position 16 (a isovaline here, represented here as V ). Warning: this is a peptaibol. In the APD, alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib or methylalanine) is represented by A in the sequence. The N-terminal resididue is acetylated and the C-terminus is a leucinol (i.e., CH2OH rather than COOH).",
