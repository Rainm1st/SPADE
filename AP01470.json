  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Compared to WAMP-1a, WAMP-1b contains one additional Arg at the C-terminus. 10-Cys. MOA: This proteinase of fungi (fungalysin Fv-cmp) cleaves class IV chitinases, plant defense proteins that bind and degrade chitin of fungal cell walls. However, equal molar ratio of plant defensin WAMP-1b or WAMP-2 to chitinase was sufficient to block the fungalysin activity of fungi keeping the plant chitinase intact. Thus, WAMPs represent a novel type of protease inhibitors (enzyme inhibitor) being active against fungal metalloproteases (Slavokhotova etal., 2014). UPdated 8/2014.",
