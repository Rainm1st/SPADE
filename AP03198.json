    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (38.67%) tobacterial AmylocyclicinGRAVY: 0.563; Mol formula: C319H532N83O90S3; Mol Wt: 7089.397, and Mol ex coeff.: 16650.Production and purification: This peptide was produced during the exponential phase. Purified from the overnight supernatant in 2 steps.Activity:  Inhibited the growth of  B. cereus ATCC 14579 on solid medium. MIC: B. cereus ATCC 14579 and 49064 (MIC 0.29-0.39 uM) and L. monocytogenes strains LM201, CMC54002, ATCC 19115 (MIC 0.39-0.78 uM), B. amyloliquefaciens X1 (MIC6.25 uM), B. thuringiensis BMB171 or YBT-1518 (MIC 0.39-0.78 uM), B. firmus DS-1 (MIC 3.13 uM), B. subtilis 168 (MIC 1.56 uM), B. pumilus SCG1 (MIC 12.5 uM), and E. faecalis ATCC29212/ATCC51299 (MIC 6.25-12.5 uM). Not active against S.aureus ATCC29213/CMCC26003, E.coli BL21/DH5alpha, S.enterica serotype Paratyphi CMCC50094, P.aeruginosa ATCC27853, P.putida Pri3, . Cerecyclin is also able to inhibit spore outgrowth at greater than 0.125 uM.Toxicity:  Not hemo.lytic till 500 uM (<2% hemolysis). The excellent activity and poor hemo.lytic toxicity of this candidate deserve further studies (potential lead).Antimicrobial robustness:  It is more stable than nisin A in the range pH 7-10 and at 37oC and 65oC.
