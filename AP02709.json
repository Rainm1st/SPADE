    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE poorly similar to (37.5%)WLBU2.Surface immobilized peptide: This peptide, consisting of the C-terminal regions of melittin and protamine, has been covalently immobilized 2008 via the N-terminus. Melimine coated contact lens reduced bacterial colonization (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa) by ~70%.",
