    "Literature": "APD analysis in 3/2020 revealed this sequence is 64.3% similar toTemporin-1RNa.  Active against M. luteus (MIC 3.3 uM), S. aureus (7.9 uM), B. subtilis (13.1 uM), S. epidermidis (13.1 uM), S. dysenteriae (26.2uM), E. coli (31.4 uM), K. pneumoniae (31.4 uM), and C. albicans (52.5 uM).  Also found by Shang et al. (2009) (ref see AP605), which reported the peptide is active against S. aureus, B. cereus, S. lactis and E. coli (MIC 12.8-25.6 uM). Showed ~11% hemolysis at (100 ug/ml peptide to 10% hRBCs, v/v). Found in multiple species.Updated 3/2020",
