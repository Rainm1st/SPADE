  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (94.74%) toPSTO2 SRK: 26%, L=A: 21%, I: 11%.Activity: active against Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 6538 or MRSA NCTC 12493 (MIC 2 uM), Gram- E. coli ATCC 8739 (MIC 2 uM), A. baumannii BAA 747 (MIC  2 uM),  K. pneumonia ATCC 43816 (MIC 2 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027 (MIC 16 uM), and fungi C. albicans (MIC 32 uM). Rapid killing at 1xMIC. It binds to LPS.  inhibit biofilms:bacteria (S. aureus and E. coli); eradicate preformed biofilms:S. aureus; eradicate preformed biofilms:E. coli.Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-insensitive:S. aureus; KCl-insensitive:S. aureus; NH4Cl-insensitive:S. aureus;  CaCl2-insensitive:S. aureus; MgCl2-insensitive:S. aureus; FeCl3-insensitive:S. aureus. NaCl-insensitive:E. coli; KCl-insensitive:E. coli; NH4Cl-insensitive:E. coli;  CaCl2-sensitive:E. coli; MgCl2-insensitive:E. coli; FeCl3-insensitive:E. coli. serum-insensitive:S. aureus (10% FBS);  serum-sensitive:E. coli (10% FBS).MOA:bacteria:  it permeated bacterial membranes of S. aureus MRSA. Also permeated the outer membranes of E. coli.Structure: random coils in 10 mM NH4Ac and helical in 50% TFE.In vitro toxicity: horse RBC: HC50 32 uM. It showed toxicity to both cancer and non-cancer cells.SAR: Changing lyine to D-amino acids can reduce activity against Gram+ bacteria and retain activity against Gram- bacteria.  with an increase in D-lysine, the peptide helixity reduces and toxicity decreases. SRD7: K7 (D-amino acid); SR2D10: K7 and K18 (D-amino acid); D1: K7, K10, and K18 (D-amino acid);  D2: K7, K10, K13, K17, and K18 (D-amino acid).",
