    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (39.29%) tofrog Caerin 2.6A peptide corresponding to the helical region of human CXCL10 (see AP02080). K: 23%; S: 18%. GRAVY: -1.159; M Wt: 2466.894; Mol formula: C107H193N33O32; Mol ex coeff: 0.Activity: alamarBlue analysis: P9 reduced the viability of A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, S. typhi, N. gonorrhoeae strains FA1090 and H041, E. coli clinical isolate FI-4531 that expresses mcr-1, colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae clinical isolates, E. faecium, but not S.aureus at 5.6 uM in Kph buffer + 1% TSB (low salt media). This activity is lost against in RPMI medium even at 50 uM. Salt-sensitive (RPMI with physiological levels of salts).Structure: it is ramdom in Kph buffer-only but became helical in 50% TFE or in liposomes that mimic bacterial membranes.Peptide engineering:in some instances (e.g., S. flexneri, K. pneumoniae MS84) the pre-stapled variant outperformed stapled P9.Toxicity:  at bactericidal concnetration (50 uM), the peptide was not toxic to hRBC. With and without stapling, P9 is toxic to T cells (45 and 75% killing). Irrespective of the culture medium, the pre-stapled variant exerted significantly more cytotoxicity than stapled peptide P9.
