    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (80%) toparent peptide P1. designed based on P1. L: 20%; V=A=G: 10%; R=K: 15%. GRAVY: 0.305; M Wt: 2222.789; M formula: C103H184N32O22, mol ex coeff: 0.Activity: active against E. coli ML-35 (MIC 1 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 or resistant strains (MIC 2-4 uM), S. typhimurium ATCC 14028 (MIC 4-8 ug/ml), S. aureus 710A or MRSA (MIC 2-8 uM), and B. megaterium BM11 (MIC 2 uM). Also active against drug-resistant strains S. simulans 22 (MIC 2 uM), M. luteus (MIC 1 uM), Enterococcus spp (MIC 1-2 uM), S. haemolyticus I-10925 (MIC 1.5 uM), S. epidermidis (MIC 1.5 uM), C. freundii I-11090 (MIC 2 uM), K. pneumoniae I-10910 (MIC 1 uM), S. maltophila O-16451 or I-10717 (MIC 1-1.5 uM), and C. albicans (MIC 4 uM or greater),Toxicity: 15% hemolysis at 10 uM and 40% hemolysis at 100 uM (HC50 > 100 uM): less hemo.lytic than P1.Structure: peptide (40 uM) became helical in 50% TFE or 10 mM SDS.",
