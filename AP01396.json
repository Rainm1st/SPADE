    "Literature": "Discovery:  In 2022, the same sequence has also been reported for a related frog.  Found in multiple species.Activity: The peptide activity has been determined (Fan et al., 2022).   Active against Gram- V. vulnificus (MIC 12.5 ug/mL), P. mirabilis (MIC 100 ug/ml), S. enterica (MIC 100 ug/ml), S. sonnei (MIC 100 ug/ml), A.hydrophila (MIC>100 ug/ml), E.coli (MIC>100 ug/ml), Gram+ S. iniae (MIC 100 ug/mL), S. epidermidis (MIC 25 ug/mL), L.monocytogenes (MIC > 100 ug/ml).  Scrash healing and chemotactic activity were observed.Updated 7/2021; 9/2022; 2/2025",
