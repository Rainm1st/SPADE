    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (40.54%) toStyelin DK:30%; V: 16%;G: 14%. GRAVY: -0.86; Mol Wt: 4349.204; Mol formula: C210H330N56O43; mol ex coeff:  23690.Activity: Active against B. clausii (MIC 3.1 ug/ml), S. epidermidis ATCC 700565 (MIC 3.1 ug/ml), E. coli O4 (MIC 50 ug/ml), P. mirabilis ATCC 29906  (MIC 6.3 ug/ml), and S. cerevisiae (MIC 6.3 ug/ml). Lower MBC of 12.5 ug/ml was found for S. epidermidis and S. cerevisiae, indicating a bactericidal effect.Antimicrobial robustness: Thermal stability: MIC 6.3 ug/mL against S. epidermidis after heating for 15 min at 100oC. More active at a basic pH than acidic pH (pH-sensitive). (salt-insensitive) MIC remained the same under physiological 150 mM NaCl, although it increased with an increase in salt concentrations from 300 mM to 600 mM.MOA: the peptide has an effect on cell morphology.
