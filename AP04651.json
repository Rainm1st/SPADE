  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (58.33%) toCecropin CK=A: 18%, R=L: 12%. GRAVY: -0.309; Mol Wt: 3854.68; mol formula: C181H300N53O39; mol ex coeff: 7040.Activity: inhibited P. falciparum 3D7 (IC50 12.4 uM). In addiiton, it inhibited bacterial growth S. aureus (MIC 30 uM), B. subtilis (MIC 3.75 uM), and E. coli (MIC 3.75 uM).In vitro toxicity: 4% hemolysis at 40 uM (incubation 1h).In vivo toxicity:mice: no weight change in an oral toxicity test at 100 mg/kg, but weight loss was observed at 200 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg.Animal model:mouse: at 25 mg/kg, inhibited infection by 5.12% only. However, the B1 peptide worked better.",
