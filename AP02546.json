    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence  is 49.27% similar toBact1. Moderately active against B. subtilis; M. luteus; E. faecalis; P. aeruginosa; Y. enterocolitica; and A. calcoaceticus (MIC 27-65 uM). It likely targets at bacterial sodium channels.  Low hemolytic (7.6 and 21%) at 90 and 180 uM.  Provided by Xiuqing Wang.",
