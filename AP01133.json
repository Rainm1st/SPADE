    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: 87.5% similar to its parent peptide plicatamide (AP01357) by changing the last modified moiety to tyrosine. This is a close analog of plicatamide. F=H: 38%; Y=L: 13%.Activity: It inhibited E. coli ML-35p, P. aeruginosa MR3007, S. aureus 930918-3, and L. monocytogenes EGD in radial diffusion assays, but inactive in microdilution expperiments. This might result from the bacterstatic effect of the peptide.SAR: for the PL-102 analog, the C-terminus is not amidated (i.e., acidic form). PL-101 is more active at pH 7.4 than at pH 5.5. PL-101 is much more active than PL-102, indicating the importance of C-terminal amidation.The original has been merged with AP1109. Updated 7/2021",
