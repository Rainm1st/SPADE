    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (72.09%) toLactolisterin BUMol Wt:  3615.282; GRAVY: -0.17; Mol Formula:  C170H258N44O39S2; mol ex coeff: 23690.Discovery: a breakdown peptide during purification of its parent peptide.Chemical modification: the N-terminal Met is N-formylated.Activity: active against L. lactis BGMN1-596 (MIC 64 ug/ml), S. aureus ATCC25923 (MIC 86.67 ug/ml), and L.monocytogenes ATCC19111 (MIC 158.33 ug/ml). Synthetic peptide showed similar activity.SAR: of note LBU1-24, a shorter synthetic peptide with 24 residues,is more active than LBU1-31.  Updated 9/2024",
