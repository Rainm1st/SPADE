    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: Compared to Pn-AMP2 (APD entry 1052), Pn-AMP1 contains one additional residue (Ser) at the C-terminus. Rich in G;Chemical modification:  contains four disulfide bonds.Activity: Active against B. cinerea (IC50 16 ug/ml), C. langenarium  (IC50 4 ug/ml), S. sclerotiorum  (IC50 11 ug/ml), F. oxysporum (IC50 10 ug/ml), S. cerevissiae (IC50 14 ug/ml), R. solani (IC50 26 ug/ml), P. capsici (IC50 5 ug/ml), Pythium spp.  (ND), and P. parasitica (IC50 3 ug/ml).  It also inhibited B. subtilis (IC50 38 ug/ml) but not E.coli, A.tumefaciens.Antimicrobial robustness: Active against fungi even if they do not contain chitin. CaCl2-sensitive:B. cinerea (5 mM); CaCl2-sensitive:C. langenarium (5 mM); CaCl2-sensitive:S. sclerotiorum (5 mM); CaCl2-sensitive:F. oxysporum (5 mM); CaCl2-sensitive:R. solani (5 mM); CaCl2-sensitive:P. capsici (5 mM);  CaCl2-sensitive:P. parasitica (5 mM); CaCl2-sensitive:S. cerevisiae  (5 mM); antifungal activity was substantially reduced (IC50 >200 ug/ml) or even lost when mediam A was sipplemented wit 5 mM CaCl2.Peptide stability: heat-stable after treat at 80oC for 15 min. lost antifungal activity at pH 2 (acidic pH) or addition of a reducing agents (e.g. DTT).MOA:fungi:  It most likely perturbs the membranes. In addition, Pn-AMP1 causes depolarization of the actin cytoskeleton in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans (Koo et al., 2004).Resistance mechanism:  signaling pathways related to the alkaline pH stress contribute to resistance to Pn-AMP1 (Kwon et al., 2016).Plant protection:tobacco: Transgenic plants: expression of this peptide in tobacco improves resistance to pathogens (Montesinos E 2007 FEMS Microbiol Lett 270, 1-11).UniprotUpdated 4/2019; 11/2024; 12//2024 GW.",
