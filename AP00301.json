    "Literature": "Discovery: Reported to be the first antimicrobial peptide ever purified from scorpion venom.Host expression:constitutive: The scorpion makes hadrurin as a cytolytic poison for an attack of its prey and as an antimicrobial defense molecule to stop putative invasive microorganisms.Activity: Active against E. coli ATCC 25926 (MIC 10 uM), S. marscencens ATCC 13880 (MIC 10 uM), E. cloacae 129 (MIC 10 uM), S. thyphi (MIC 40 uM),  and K. pneumoniae (MIC 40 uM).SAR: The amidated form is slightly more active, while the activity of the D-form (peptide made of D-amino acids) is identical to the L-form.MOA:bacteria:  D=L; membrane.Structure: it is a unique peptide predicted to have two helical regions.In vitro toxicity:  human RBC: highly hemolytic, 80% hemolysis at 20 uM (HC50 <10 uM). The D-form showed 100% hemolysis at 5 uM.UPdated 3/2015; 7/2021; Jan2025",
