    "Literature": "51.35% similar toAP2424 Crotalicidin. More similar to reptile cathelicidin than to other amphibian peptides. Rich in K (32%).Activity: Active against Gram- E. coli (MIC 2.8-5.7 uM), S. dysenteriae, K. peneumoniae (MIC 5.7-22 uM), K.peneumoniae (MIC >200 for one strain), K. oxytoca (MIC 1.43 uM), P. mirabilis (MIC 5.7 uM), S. maltophilia (MIC 11.4 uM), S. maltophilia, P. aeruginosa ATCC27853 (MIC 2.9 uM) (mostly clinical strains), Gram+ bacteria S. aureus (3 active MIC 2.9 uM; 3 inactive MIC>200 uM), B. subtilis,  S. epidermidis, E. faecium (MIC 2.9 uM), N. asteroides, E. faecalis (MIC 22.8 uM), and fungi C. albicans (clinical strains, MIC 2.9 to >200 uM).Antimicrobial robustness:  Activity against E. coli ATCC25922 is salt-sensitive (4.7 uM no salt, 4.7 uM at 100 uM NaCl, 18.8 uM at 400 mM NaCl).
