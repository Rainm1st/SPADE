  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Pep27anal2 characterized substituting (2R-->W), (4E-->W), (11S-->W) and (13Q-->W) in native Pep27, exhibited greater hydrophobicity and anticancer activity than Pep27 and other analogues. The IC50 values of Pep27anal2 were approximately 10 - 30 microM in a number of cell lines (AML-2, HL-60, Jurkat, MCF-7 and SNU-601). The antibacterial activities of Pep27 are fundamentally attributable to a physiological change by activated phosphatase activity (Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2007 Nov 23;363(3):806-10).",
