    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide most resembles (37.5% similarity)Paenicidin A.Chemical modification:   Six thioether bonds are possible.Structure:  Random coil in membrane-mimetic environments.Activity: Unlike other lantibiotics, penisin is active against both Gram+ S. aureus (MIC ~3 uM), L. monocytogenes (MIC ~1 uM), B. subtilis (~1.5 uM)  and Gram- bacteria E. coli (MIC 1.58 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 0.75 uM) and V. cholerae (MIC ~7 uM). 30 min incubation with 5 x MIC killed 100% MRSA.In vitro toxicity: it is poorly hemo.lytic at 100 uM (<4% lysis of rabbit RBCs).Animal model:mouse: bacteremia:(S. aureus infection,  penisin at 80 mg/kg efficiently protected 80% of the BALB/c mice, which survived even after 8 days.Updated 10/2024",
