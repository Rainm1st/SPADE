    "Literature": "Discovery: isolated from skin secretion via RP-HPLC.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (92.31%) toTemporin-PMaF: 31%, L: 23%. GRAVY: 1.538, mol Wt: 1485.832, mol formula: C78H112N14O15, mol ex coeff: 0. It differs from Temporin-PMa only at a single position, F for this peptide and L for AP3610 (PMa).Chemical modification:  C-terminal amidation.Activity: active against E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 16 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883 (MIC 16 uM) but KPC strain MIC>128 uM AMP-resistant?  P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 32 uM) also MDR MIC>128 uM AMP-resistant?, and S. aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC 8 uM) also MRSA MIC>128 uM AMP-resistant? Bacterial resistant strains: A. baunmannii MDR (MIC 8 uM).Cytotoxicity:  cytotoxic to HeLa (IC50 32.4 uM) and MCF7 cancer cells (IC50 24.1 uM), keratinocytes (IC50 25.0 uM), and highly hemolytic above 64 uM (HC50 32-64 uM) but poorly hemolytic at 16 uM or less.SAR:  The peptide lost activity without C-terminal amidation.",
