    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (54.84%) toBrevinin-2GHbA:22%; K=T=L=V=13%. GRAVY:  0.421; M. Wt: 2357.818; Mol formula: C106H186N30O29; Mol Ex Coeff: 0;Activity:  Active against Gram+ bacteria S. aureus (MIC 16 uM), S.mutans (MIC >100 uM), Gram- E. coli (MIC 64 uM), P.aeruginosa, and fungi C.albicans (MIC >100 uM). It also inhibited 70% biofilm formation of S. aureus at 0.5 MIC and completely inhibited at the MIC. It reduced 24-h preformed staph biofilms by 20%. Heating up to 100oC or changing pH from 2 to 9, UV irridation for 30 min, and increasing NaCl to 400 mM had little effect on activity.Toxicity:  the peptide is not hemo.lytic till 200 uM (1.6% lysis).",
