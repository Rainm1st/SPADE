  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Extracts from Viscum album L. are widely used as an adjuvant in complementary cancer therapy.  Treatment of lymphocytes with VT for 2 hours resulted in the binding of Annexin-V, permeabilisation of cell membranes, and generation of ROI (Bussing A et al., 1998).  Mistletoe extracts have immunomodulatory activity by increasing natural killer (NK) cell-mediated killing of tumor cells but spare nontarget cells from NK lysis (Tabiasco et al., 2002).  The arrangement of the cysteine pairing was determined as Cys3-Cys40, Cys4-Cys32 and Cys16-Cys26.  The 3D structure of this peptide has been determined to high resolution (1.25 A) by X-ray crystallography (Pal A et al., 2008).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.
