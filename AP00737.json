  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "The GXXXG motif. The peptide is disordered in water but helical in the presence of membrane-mimicking agents (TFE, SDS, DPC, or lipids DMPC and DMPG). 3D structure was determined in TFE, SDS and DPC. It is mainly helical with the C-terminus disordered, more in DPC (Carlier L et al., 2015). Updated 12/2015.",
