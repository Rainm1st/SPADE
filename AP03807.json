  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Peptide design: GI-20 corresponds to residues 13-32 of human LL-37 with the position between I13 and G14 swapped.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (85%) toGF-17I=K=R: 15%; V=L=F: 10%; GRAVY: -0.225;Activity: It inhibits HIV-1. Active against E. faecium V284-17 (MIC 2 uM), S. aureus USA300 (MIC 2-4 uM), K-pneumoniae E406-17 (MIC>32 uM). A. baumannii B28-16 (MIC 8 uM), P-aeruginosa E411-17 (MIC > 32 uM), and E. coli E423-17 (MIC 32 uM). It also disperse preformed biofilms (Zhang et al., 2021).Virus: inhibited Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 HIV-1 (EC50 1.08 uM, TC50 22.7 uM) (Wang et al., 2008).Structure: Like LL-37, it is helical even in PBS. 3D structure has been determined by NMR.MOA:bacteria: it permeabilized bacterial membranes.Toxicity: human RBC: HC50 ~150 uM, some hemolytic.",
