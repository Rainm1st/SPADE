    "Literature": "Chemical modification:  Chain A (shown) is connected with chain B (EVGKYCAVAHAIH, amidated) via a disulfide bond. In chain B, the N-terminal Q is pyroglutamic acid (Glp). Trp is bromated at position 6 (6-bromotryptophan).Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of chain A shows 46.8% similarity toEeCentrocin 1.Activity: Active against Gram+ B. subtilis (MIC 6.25 uM), C. glutamicum (MIC 0.78 uM), S. aureus (MIC 6.25 uM), S. epidermidis (MIC 3.13 uM), Gram- E. coli (MIC 1.56-6.25 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 0.78-6.25 uM), fungi A. pullulans (MIC 25 uM), C. albicans (MIC 50 uM), Cladosporium sp.
