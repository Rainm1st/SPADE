    "Literature": "A chemokine that initiates chemotaxis via the ChemR23 G protein-coupled seven transmemrbane receptor. Truncation of the C-terminal six residues is required to activate peptide chemotactic activity. While chemS157 (with C-terminal residue 158-163 removed) and chemR125 (with C-terminal 126-163 removed) are equally antibacterial against E. coli and K. pneumoniae, chemR125 is not chemotactic.  In a subsequent study using overlapping synthetic peptides, the major antibacterial region of chemerin was mapped to the segment Val(66)-Pro(85), which causes direct bacterial lysis (seePLoS One. 2013;8(3):e58709). The MIC values of this p4 fragment is 12.5 uM against S. aureus, 3.1-6.3 uM against E. coli,  6.3 uM P. aeruginosa, 6.3 uM against C. albicans.",
