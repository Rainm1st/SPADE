    "Literature": "Chemical modification:  The single Cys residue will link with another short peptide chain DLRAICAGAHAL to form the complete two chain AMP.  In addition, the Trp residue is brominated.Activity: Active against Gram- L. anguillarum serotype O2 (MIC 2.5 uM), E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 2.5 uM), Gram+ C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 (MIC 1.3 uM), and S. aureus ATCC 9144 (MIC 5.0 uM). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was set at the lowest concentration of peptide reducing the OD to less than 50% of the growth control.Updated 7/2021; 11/2023",
