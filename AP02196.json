  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Like Abeta-42, this peptide inhibits the growth of both E. coli and S. aureus.Chemical modification:  One disulfide bond between C2 and C7.Structure:  the peptide shows helical feature in PG/Cl lipid bilayer (CD). 3D Structure was determined in SDS micelles. A kinked helix formed by residues 7–17 and 21–28 at neutral pH.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure bound to SDS micellesherein the PDB. The peptide can also form amyloid (Amyloid AMPs). This aggregate does not change structure in lipid bilaer but remained antimicrobial (see the ref).AMP significance:  An S20G variant is detected in Asians.
