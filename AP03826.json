    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (57.14%) toLL14. Synthetic peptide is C-terminally amidated. K: 43%; V: 43%. GRAVY: 2.53; M Wt: 1754.259; M formula: C88H150N22O15, mol ex coeff: 11100.Activity: active against E. coli DH5alpha (MIC 5 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 15 uM), S. typhi TY2S (MIC 5 uM), S. aureus (MIC 15 uM), K. pneumoniae (MIC 5 uM), C. albicans (MIC 2.5 uM), C. neoformans (MIC 2.5 uM), and C. grubii (MIC 2.5 uM). Non-standard assay: Very low MIC values resulted from 4 h incubation of bacteria in 10 mM PBS followed by overlaying with media for overnight incubation.Toxicity: human RBC: poorly hemo.lytic (~10% from 5 to 100 uM), HC50 >> 100 uM. HEK293 (IC50 >200 uM), L132 cells (IC50 200 uM).Structure: helical in SDS or 50% TFE. 3D structure in SDS by NMR.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.MOA:bacteria: act on membranes.",
