    "Literature": "C-terminal NH2.Activity: Active against S. aureus (MIC 3.5 uM), E. coli (MIC 20 uM), and C. albicans (MIC 19 uM).Also, AR-23 exhibited a greater inhibitory activity in the early stages of infection against both DNA (HSV-1) and RNA (MeV, HPIV-2, HCoV-229E, and SARS-CoV-2) enveloped viruses and, on the contrary, it was inactive against naked viruses (PV-1). Also inhibit bovine and caprine herpesviruses, canine distemper virus, bovine viral diarrhea virus, and Schmallenberg virus (Chianese et al., 2023).Toxicity: highly hemolytic (LC50 8 uM) (Annalisa Chianese et al., 2022).Updated 5/2020; 7/2021; 9/2023",
