    "Literature": "Activity: Active against Gram-positive B. megaterium, B. subtilis, S. aureus (MRSA), S. epidermidis, M. luteus, B. cereus and Gram-negative bacteria P. aeruginosa and A. tumefaciens. A helical structure between residues 7-18 and two beta-strands between residues 22-26 and 32-36.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.  Of great interest is that the peptide showed a low toxic effect on mammalian cells compared to meucin-49. There is no decrease in activity in the presence of serum  after over 24 hr incubation.  Animal model:mouse. The peptide protects mice from death. Updated 2/2014.",
