  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Host expression: Injection of bacterial LPS induces the production of this peptide.Activity: Although papiliocin displayed a broad antimicrobial spectrum, it is especially active against Gram-negative bacteria. Active against Gram- E. coli (MIC 0.25 uM), S. typhimurium (MIC 0.50 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 1.0 um), Gram+ S. aureus (MIC 32 uM), B. subtilis (MIC 16 uM), and S. epidermidis (MIC 2.0 uM).Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-sensitive:S. epidermidis (150 mM); NaCl-sensitive:E. coli (150 mM); NaCl-insensitive:S. typhimurium (150 mM); NaCl-insensitive:P. aeruginosa (150 mM);  CaCl2-sensitive:E. coli (3-5 mM); CaCl2-sensitive:S. typhimurium (5 mM); CaCl2-sensitive:P. aeruginosa (5 mM); MgCl2-sensitive:E. coli (3-5 mM); MgCl2-insensitive:S. typhimurium (3-5 mM); MgCl2-insensitive:P. aeruginosa (3-5 mM).MOA:fungi:  This cecropin-like membrane-active peptide may form a pore (2.3-3.3 nm) in the fungal membranes (J Microbiol Biotechnol. 2010 Aug;20(8):1185-8).  It could also induce yeast apoptosis (Hwang B et al 2011 Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 408: 89-93). The peptide also showed anti-inflammatory activities.Structure:  In DPC micelles, the peptide adopted a helix-hinge-helix conformation (H1:residues 3-21 and H2: 25-36). Residues W2 and F5 are proposed to be important for LPS binding (Kim JK et al. 2011 J Biol Chem 286:41296-311).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure determined in DPC micellesherein the PDB.Toxicity:  Not hemo.lytic at 100 uM.
