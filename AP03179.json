    "Literature": "Peptide discovery: Found in multiple species.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (80%) toBrevinin-1GHa.Activity: Active against S. aureus or MRSA (MIC 2-4 uM), E. coli (MIC 8 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 32 uM), C. albicans (MIC 4 uM).It binds LPS and shows anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing the release of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 from mouse RAW 264.7 cells (Tian et al., 2023.Structure:  the peptide is random coiled in water and became helical in complex with SDS, LPS, or SDS+LPS.Animal model:mouse: inflammation model (acute edema) was established with carrageenan administration. IP injection of the peptide alleviated the swelling of the \nright paw of mice, thereby showing the anti-inflammatory effect in vivo as well.Replaced with a more active peptide 5/2020; formatted 4/2024; 8/2024",
