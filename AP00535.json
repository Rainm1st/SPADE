    "Literature": "Structure:  Random coil in water but helical in the presence of 50% TFE. The N-terminal 20 residues are likely to be the dominating antimicrobial region (Zelezetsky I et al. 2005 Arch Bichem Biophys. 434: 358-364). Its structure has been determined by NMR.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure of N-terminal peptide P1herein the PDB.Activity:Toxicity: it completely disrupted RBC at 40 uM after 24 h incubation, stronger than melittin. Activity is lost in serum.",
