    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals 82.98% sequence similar to frog Defensin-TK (AP2605). Mol formula: C227H339N57O64S7; Mol Wt: 5125.984; GRAVY: 0.42.Activity: Active against V. vulnificus ATCC 279562 (MIC 3.75 ug/ml), V. harveyi ATCC33866 (MIC 50 ug/ml) in TSB medum, A. hydrophila ATCC7966 (MIC 100 ug/ml) in LB medum, S. iniae ATCC29178E (MIC 50 ug/ml) in BHI medium, inactive: E.coli K12 (MIC >100 ug/ml) and L. monocytogenes ATCC19115 (MIC >100 ug/ml). In addition, QS-BD treatment promoted respiratory bursts and upregulated the expression of interleukin-1beta and tumour necrosis factor-alpha in the murine leukemic monocyte/macrophage cell line RAW264.7, implying a pro-inflmmatory effect.",
