  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of  BG-CATH37 shows 39.1% similarity toBovine Beta-defensin 11.Activity:  active against habitat bacteria A. hydrophila (MIC 40 ug/ml), V. splendidus (MIC 6.25 ug/ml), and S. iniae (MIC 12.5 ug/ml), but inactive: E.coli ATCC 25922, P.aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and S.aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC >200 ug/ml). An alternative cleaved form of the peptide is BG-CATH(5-37), which lacks the N-terminal 4 residues of BG-CATH37, is also active against these bacteria  (gram- A. hydrophila, MIC 12.5 ug/ml; V. splendidus, MIC 3.1 ug/ml; Gram+ S. iniae, MIC 12.5 ug/ml). Which one corresponds to the native mature peptide remains to be established via isolation from the toad.Toxicity: Notably, synthetic forms of these peptides showed no hemo.lytic activity at 400 ug/mL.Structure: CD showed mainly random coils in water or in the presence of SDS or TFE.
