    "Literature": "Activity: Activity against G+ and G- bacteria such as  E. coli (MIC 5 uM),  S. aureus (MIC 2 uM), and B. cereus (MIC 5 uM), and P. aeruginosa (MIC 38 uM) (this ref). Also active against S. aureus (MIC 2 uM), C. albicans (EC50 12.9 uM) and C. neoformans (EC50 11.0 uM) (Silva JC et al., 2017). Polybia-MPII peptides were able to inhibit cells that were dispersed from the formed biofilm (das Neves RC et al., 2019).Toxicity: This toxin (peptide) also induce lysis of rat erythrocytes.   human RBC: HC50 23.3 uM; rat RBC: HC50 29.1 uM (Ye et al., 2023).In addition, the peptide presents mast cell degranulation activity, LDH release from the cytoplasm of mast cells, chemotaxis for PMNL.Structure: Helical in the presence of SDS or TFE.Discovery: Found in multiple species. The same sequence is also found for Polybia-MPII from Pseudopolybia vespiceps testacea.Update 10/2010; seq corrected by August Junge 5/2017; 4/2019; 7/2021; 4/2024; 7/2024.",
