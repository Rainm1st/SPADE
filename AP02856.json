    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (40%) toTritrpticinW: 50%; R: 38%; L:13%. Mol. Wt: 1344.591; GRAVY: -1.66; Mol. ex. coeff.: 22200.Activity: Active against E. faecium V286-17 (VRE) (MIC 2 uM), S. aureus USA300 LAC MRSA and 30 clinical strains (MIC 2-8 uM), K-pneumoniae E406-17 (MIC >32 uM),  A. baumannii B28-16 (MIC 32 uM), P-aeruginosa E411-17 (MIC >32 uM), and E. coli E423-17 (MIC 16-32 uM). It is primarily active against Gram+ pathogens, inlcuding 32 S. aureus clinical strains (MIC50 4 uM). It killed most of MRSA in the 48 h preformed biofilms at 2-4 MIC.Structure: The 3D NMR structure of TetraF2W-RK (parent of horine) bound to membrane-mimetic micelles DPC has been determined by the improved 2D NMR method. The peptide forms the shortest 2-turn amphipathic helix.You can rotate, zoom, and view the structureherein the PDB.MOA:bacteria: it permeabilized S. aureus membranes (also D=L).Resistance development:no:bacteria:S. aureus: S. aureus USA300 LAC did not develop resistance to horine during a multiple passage experiment.SAR: A triple WWW motif at the N-terminus is essential for membrane targeting and killing of MRSA in biofilms (Zarena et al., 2017).In vitro toxicity: very low hemol.lytic hRBC (HC50 >200 uM), other cytotoxicity: human hepatic progenitor liver cell (HepaRG (LC50 >80 uM), human kidney HEK293 (LC50 >100 uM), human lung fibroblasts (MRC9) (LC50>35 uM), and mouse splenocytes (LC50 >50 uM).Half-life in vitro:plasma:human:  half life is 15 min.In vivo PK:mice:  IV blood plasma half life is less than 15 min. However, d-horine, made of D-amino acids, has a half life of up to 1 h.In vivo toxicity:mice:  horine did not display toxic effects to kidney (nephrotoxicity) after one week of daily injection to mice or In vivo toxicity:rats.Animal model:mouse: neutropenic model: horine showed systemic efficacy in mice when administered either intraperitoneally (i.p.) or intravenously (i.v.) against MRSA infection.Surface immobilized peptide:TBA.Entry history: The original TetraF4W-RK has been replaced by the advanced version.Updated 7/2020; 7/2021; 6/2022; 11/2023; 11/2024; 4/2025",
