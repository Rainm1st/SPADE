    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (68.75%) toP5-NT1. Synthetic peptide is C-terminally amidated. K: 43%; L: 43%. GRAVY: -0.171; M Wt: 1838.421; M formula: C94H162N22O15, mol ex coeff: 11100.Activity: active against E. coli DH5alpha (MIC 5 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 10 uM), S. typhi TY2S (MIC 5 uM), S. aureus (MIC 10 uM), K. pneumoniae (MIC 5 uM), C. albicans (MIC 5 uM), C. neoformans (MIC 2.5 uM), and C. grubii (MIC 2.5 uM). Non-standard assay: Very low MIC values resulted from 4 h incubation of bacteria in 10 mM PBS followed by overlaying with media for overnight incubation. This practice led to little differences between the LL and VV peptides.Toxicity: human RBC: highly hemolytic (90% hemolysis at 5 uM). HEK293 (IC50 10-20 uM) and L132 cells (IC50 10-20 uM).Structure: helical in SDS or 50% TFE.MOA:bacteria: act on membranes.",
