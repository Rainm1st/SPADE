  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "His-rich; Antifungal activity against C. parapsilosis and C. albicans. pH-dependent. Disrupt liposomes at pH 6.0 within a few hundread seconds but inactive at pH 7.4. The peptide showed no conformational changes with pH or upon binding to liposomes. GHH20 has similar characteristic as the holoprotein HRG with respect to activity, binding, and membrane permebilization.",
