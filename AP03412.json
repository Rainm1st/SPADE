    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (47.73%) toplant Pn-AMP2C: 21%; S: 18%, G: 23%. Mol formula: C147H222N43O55S8; Mol Wt:3740.153; Mol Ex Coeff: 9030; GRAVY:  -0.223.Activity:  active against fungi A. alternata (IC50 239 uM), C. lunata (74 uM), F. oxysporum (IC50 53 uM), and R. solani (77 uM).Structure:  disulfide bonds: C1-C4, C2-C5, C3-C6, and C7-C8.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Carbohydrate binding:  The chitin binding site consists of Ser-15, Trp-17, Tyr-19 and Tyr-26, where  the three conserved aromatic residues, Trp-17, Tyr-19, and Tyr-26 in the avenatide aV1 chitin-binding site, play an essential role in binding to planar chitin monomers. The peptide did bind to chitin beads at 25oC.Stability: the S-S bonds are critical for peptide stability against heat, acid, and proteases.",
