    "Literature": "Chemical modification:  The N-terminus is a pyroglutamate.Discovery: Such peptides are amphibian homologs of the mammalian gastrin-releasing peptide. It also plays a role in defense and has neuro-endocrological functions (Life Sci. 2006; 78: 1953-56).Activity: Active against E. coli ATCC25922 (MIC 50 ug/ml), S. aureus ATCC2592 (MIC 25 ug/ml), B.pyocyaneus CMCCB10104 (MIC 150 ug/ml), and C. albicans (MIC 25 ug/ml).Structure:  CD curves with and without 160 uM SDS are not that different, indicative of mainly a randomn coil structure.",
