In particualr, CBD103 exhibits two types of genetic polymorphisms: (1) a variant allele with a 3-basepair deletion in its coding sequence, and (2) gene copy-number variation. The 3-basepair deletion in CBD103 , termed CBD103G23 , was identified as the allelic variant responsible for a dominant black coat color in dogs (Candille et al., 2007). CBD103  G23 lacks a glycine residue at the N-terminus of the mature peptide, and can bind with higher affinity than CBD103 to the melanocortin 1 receptor (Mc1r) on the surface of melanocytes. Due to its binding affinity and high expression levels, CBD103  G23 is thought to displace Agouti, an Mc1r signaling antagonist, allowing Mc1r to signal unabated, leading to the synthesis of the black pigment eumelanin and resulting in a black coat color. Additional details provided by Monique van Hoek. 2/2022.Activity: In rich medium, active against E-coli ATCC 25922, or resistant clinical strains (MIC>64 uM),  S-aureus ATCC 25923, MRSA (MIC>64 uM),  S. pseudintermedius clinical strain, no resistance (MIC 16 uM), S. pseudintermedius clinical strain, methicillin resistant (MIC 8 uM), P-aeruginosa ATCC 27853, P-hauseri ATCC 13315, E-faecalis clinical isolate (MIC >64 uM), E. faecium clinical isolate (MIC 8 uM). The peptide can kill all the tested Gram+ and - bacterial strains in a minimal medium, indicating that medium components might have deactivated the peptide.Reg. 7/2021; updated: 11/2021; 10/2024",
