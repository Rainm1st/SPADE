    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide most resembles (86.0% similarity)R. prolixus defensin A. Three pairs ofdisulfide bonds are predicted 24-41, 20-39, 3-34 and the structure is predicted to have an alphaBeta fold with one helix and a 2-stranded beta-sheet.  Active against Gram+ bacteria C. renale (MIC 8.8 uM), M. luteus (MIC 0.55 uM), and S. epidermidis (MIC 8.8 uM). It cuased depolarization and pore formation in bacterial memrbanes.
