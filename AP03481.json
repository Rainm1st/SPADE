    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (41.67%) toP1-Hp-1971L=32%, A=K=18%. GRAVY: 1.38; mol wt: 2359.126: Mol formula:  C111H196N26O23S3; Mol ex Coeff: 125 (Disulfide bond). A disulfide bond between residues 10 and 18;Activity: Active against S. aureus ATCC 33591 or USA300 (MRSA, MIC 16-64 ug/ml), E.faecalis JH2-2 (MIC 256 ug/ml), L. monocytogenes (), K.pneumoniae (MIC 512 ug/ml or higher), A. baumannii sensitive (MIC 16-32 ug/ml),  A.baumannii IMI, MER, OXA-23, OXA-50 (MIC 128-256 ug/ml), E.coli, S.typhimurium, B.cereus (MIC 256 ug/ml),  P.aeruginosa PAO1 (MIC >512 ug/ml), P.aeruginosa AMT0060 (CF) (MIC 256 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa C3719 or LES400 (MIC 64 ug/ml).MOA: the peptide appeared to work on membranes. At 3xMIC it rapidly killed USA300. There was membrane permeabilization as well.Resistance development:no:bacteria:S. aureus USA300: MRSA USA300 did not develop resistance to the peptide after 20 passages.Toxicity: HC50 50% hemo.lytic concentration is 409 ug/ml.  Lung fibroblast (i.e. IMR-90) cells, IC50 = 96 ug/ml. Lung epithelial (i.e. BEAS-2B), IC50 120 ug/ml and liver (i.e. HepG2) cells: IC50 359 ug/ml.Anti-inflmmatory: the peptide neutralizes LPS and LTA, reducing the inflammation caused by such bacterial components.Animal model:Galleria mellonella:wax moth: The peptides were effective in vivo within a Galleria mellonella model of MRSA USA300 infection.",
