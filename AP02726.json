    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE shows poor sequence similarity (74.2%) toPaenibacillin. Extensive chemical modification.Activity: Active against B. cereus, B. firmus, B. thuringiensis, B. subtilis, B. pumilus, E. faecalis, M. Paenibacillus, S. aureus, and S. sciuri. This peptide can be further modified into thuricin 4A-4D, which may result from succinylation at a lysine residue.",
