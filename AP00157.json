Active against S. aureus and E. coli (MIC 12 uM). The peptide is active against L. major (Perez-Cordero JJ et al. 2011 Peptides 32 (4), 683-90).Also showed spermicidal activity.This peptide could inhibit HIV infection at a concentration that is also toxic to T cells (J Virol 2005; 79:11598-11606). Also inhibit FV3 (IC50 =12 uM), CCV (IC50 3 uM), HSV-1 (32 uM).SAR: A segment corresponding to residue 1-18 was found to have a comparable activity to the parent peptide (JBC 1994; 269: 1934-39).Structure:  helical in TFE.
