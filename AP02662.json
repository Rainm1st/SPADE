    "Literature": "A potential mature peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 26 amino acids was predicted and synthesized. This is a unique sequence since the APD database analysis revealed a poor similarity of 34.6% toGramicidin C.  Mol. Wt: 3135.8; GRAVY: 0.93.Activity: Active against A. hydrophila ATCC 35654 (killed 77% at 25 ug/ml), and Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 25923 (killed 42% at 25 ug/ml). It binds to LPS and LTA.Structure: Helical in the presence of 50% TFE, 50 mM SDS, or 50 mM DPC.  Updated 4/2016.",
