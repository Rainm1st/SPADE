Substituting Cys by ?-amino butyric acid disrupted peptide activity, indicating the importance of disulfide bridges for the antimicrobial activity. It exhibited antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria ( (M. luteus 1.6 uM; E. coli, 7.2 uM; p. aeruginosa 100 uM; B. subtilis 3.3 uM), ), antifungal activity (MIC C. albicans 24.2 uM), and low hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (HL50 >200 uM).
