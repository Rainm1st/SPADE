    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide  shows 93.3% similarity toits related peptide H4-(86-100).Activity:  Active against E. coli (LD90 10.3 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa LD90 8.7 ug/ml), and B. subtilis (LD90 14 ug/ml). ATP can enahnce its activity, implying its involvement in inhibiting the DNA gyrase activity.",
