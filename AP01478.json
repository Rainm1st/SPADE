  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis revealed 56.6% similarity tocattle vasostatin-1.Activity:  Active against C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis,  C. krusei, and C. tropicalis at a concentration MIC < 0.5 uM with additive effects with traditional antibiotics (Li RF et al., 2015). It also inhibits the growth of lung cancer A549 cells.MOA:  it appears that the peptide can penetrates yeast membranes followed by interactions with motochondtria and inhibition of DAN synthesis (Li RF et al., 2015).SAR: Synthetic peptides, such as CGA-N16 (sequence: LQDLALQGAKERAHQQ), CGA-N15 (seq: ERILSILRHQNLLKE), CGA-N12 (seq:ALQGAKERAHQQ), and CGA-N8 (seq: GAKERAHQ), have higher antifungal activity than the parent peptide.Structure: These small peptides are helical in association with SDS micelles. CGA-N12 is a promising candidate for future developments due to its poor hemolytic toxicity (Li et al., 2016).Recombinant production:bacteria:Bacillus subtilis.  Its bacterial expression was optimized in Bacillus subtilis DB1342(p-3N46).  Replaced: The original fragment from cattle chromogranin A has been merged into theparent entry.
