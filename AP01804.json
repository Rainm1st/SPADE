  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Synthetic peptide is active against B. subtilis, E. coli (MIC 0.5 uM), P. fluorescens (MIC 1 uM), S. aureus (MIC 10 uM). This cytolytic peptide is toxic to human erythrocytes as well (EC50 7uM). There is a disulfide bond between C4 and C10 in the head (residues 1-11), which are rich in positively charged residues. The peptide is disordered in water but adopts a helical structure (residues 12-25) in DPC micelles. The peptide is also helical in 50% TFE or DOPC LUVs.You can rotate, zoom, and view the micelle-bound 3D structureherein the PDB. Updated 2/2014. The overall design of this peptide resembles frog AMPs with a rana box. APD Update 7/27/2012; 5/2015.",
