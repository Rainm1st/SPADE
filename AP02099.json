  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Has ribonuclease activity. Active against parasites (see the ref). 500 nM rhECP reduced infectivity of extracellular virions of the single-stranded RNA virus, respiratory syncytial virus, group B (RSV-B) approximately 6 fold (Domachowske JB et al. 1998). Also active against M. vaccae (Boix E et al., 2008). It binds to LPS. RNase 3 has a unique bacteria-agglutinating activity.MOA: Antimicrobial activity is proportional to membrane depolarization and permeabilizaiton (Pulido D et al. 2013).Structure: There are multiple structures in the PDB solved by X-ray and NMR methods (NMR+x).You can rotate, zoom, and view the crystal structureherein the PDB.SAR:  An N-fragment was more active than the full molecule.  Heavy glycosylation of the protein modifies protein surface significantly reduces its toxicity, thereby protecting the  the eosinophil granule from the toxicity of the stored proteinand. Heavy glycosylation also reduces its aggregation, bacterial agglutination, and membrane disruption properties (Salazar VA et al., 2014). Thus, to be more active, secreted forms are less glycosylated. In addition, Y33 can be nitrated (tyrosine nitration).Toxicity mechanism: it increases TNFalpha production and causes cell apoptosis via activation of the caspase cycle in human BEAS-2B cells (Chang et al., 2010).Updated 1/2/2014; 2/2014; 10/2014; 3/2023.",
