  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (86.67%) toCATH-2(1-15)R: 40%, F=I=K: 13%. FRP segment was repalced by MRL.Activity: active against E. coli ATCC 8739 or 6 resistant E strains (MIC 2-8 ug/ml). Warning: other bacteria not tested.In vitro toxicity: chicken RBC: ~10% hemolysis at 64 ug/ml (slightly hemo.lytic).   At this concentration, nearly all chicken kidney cells survived.Animal model:chicken: 21-day-old infected with E. coli via the pectoral muscle, 4h later, treated via the same route. Showed efficacy (treatment 70% survial vs. 30% survival no treatment; and CFU drop in organs such as liver, heart, and spleen). This peptide may be utilized to treat avian colibacillosis caused by E. coli.",
