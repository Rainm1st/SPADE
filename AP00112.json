    "Literature": "Activity: Active against S. aureus (MIC 100-110 uM).  Also active against B. dendrobatidis (Table 1, Rollins-Smith, BBA 2009; 1788:1593-1599). It is also found in North American frog Rana cascadae and named as temporin-1CSa and found active against S. aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC 8 uM) (Conlon et al 2007 Peptides 28: 1268-1274).It is also found in the mountain yellow-legged frog Rana muscosa and named as temporin-1M (Rollins-Smith LA et al. 2002 Dev Comp Immunol 26:63-72). Therefore, the same peptide has been found in multiple species. Updated 3/2015; 5/2018; 5/2020; 7/2021.",
