    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: Rich in P (33.3%).Activity: active against A. tumefaciens DSM 3129 (MIC 0.2 ug/ml), E. salicis NCPPB 2530 (MIC 0.02 ug/ml), E. coli NCTC 9001 (MIC 0.1 ug/ml), P. syringae pv. tomamta NCPPB 1105 (MIC 0.1 ug/ml), R. meliloti ZB 314 (MIC 0.02 ug/ml), S. Newport CD 94 (MIC 0.2 ug/ml), S. enterica serovar typhimurium ATCC 23565 (MIC 0.1 ug/ml), S.marcescens ATCC 17991 (MIC >200 ug/ml), S. flexneri CP 87 (MIC 0.1 ug/ml), C. insidiosum NCPPB 1109 (MIC 50 ug/ml), B.alvei LMG 6922 (MIC > 200 ug/ml), B. megaterium OMB 1551 (MIC 100 ug/ml), B.subtilis NRRL-B-237 (MIC >200 ug/ml), and B.thuringiensis tenebrionis DSM 2803 (MIC >200 ug/ml).MOA:bacteria: Api88 and Api137 interact with the 50S subunit of the 70S ribosome of bacteria. It can block the release of release factors from ribosomes. APi137 is the first such inhibitor identifed to date (Florin T et al., 2017).Recombinant production:bacteria:Streptomyces lividans: Apidaecin was expressed as a fusion protein with Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor (SSI) gene. Antibacterial activity against E. coli can be detected before and after cleavage with factor Xa (enzyme cleavage).Animal model:mouse: It displayed high efficacy in systemic E. coli and K. pneumoniae septicemia infection mouse models (Ostorhazi E et al., 2014). Apiaecin Api137 shows a dose-dependent protection of the CD-1 mice (67% survival over 5 days) from E. coli ATCC 25922 infection caused death when treated subcutaneously (continuous SC fusion) but not intravenously (Knappe et al, Front. Microbiol. 10:2283).SAR: bacterial expression library screening recovered 10 million clones with 349,199 unique sequences. Sequence and activity analysis reveals residues P11, R12, R17, and L18 are never mutated, indicating their critical role in ribosome inhibition (Huang et al., 2024).Derivatives:  Api88 (sequence: gu-ONNRPVYIPRPRPPHPRL-NH2, gu=N,N,N',N'-tetramethylguanidino) is an optimized analogue of apidaecin 1b with improved antibacterial activities. Api137 has an amino acid sequence (Gu-ONNRPVYIPRPRPPHPRL-OH) similar to Api88.Updated 7/2014; 12/2015; Jan2016; 7/2017 ; 7/2024 GW",
