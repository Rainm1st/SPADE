    "Literature": "Nomenclature: The prefix HE denotes hemolymph, the tissue of origin of the EST database.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE shows 90.4% similarity toD. silvarum defensin.Activity: A synthetic  peptide showed virucidal activity against Langat virus (LGTV).  Antibacterial activity of a shortened form, HlDFS2 (sequence without the N-terminal EEESEVAHLRVRR), has also been tested. MIC90 recorded here: Active against Gram+ bacteria M. luteus CMCC28001 (MIC 1 uM); M. bovis (MIC 0.5 uM) and Gram- bacteria E. coli CMCC44103 (MIC 1 uM); B. burgdorferi 297-GFP (MIC 20 uM) (Sun T et al. 2017).Relationhisp with disease: Till 2016, B. burgdorferi  is the only bacterium recognized to be responsible for lyme disease which was transmitted to human via the bite of infected tick.
