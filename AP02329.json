    "Literature": "Discovery:  The peptide was isolated from soybeans in 2003 (PubMed).Sequence analysis: Showed 30% similarity to EcAMP2 (AP2042). This peptide contains 8 Asp (D) residues in its carboxyl end preceded by a cell adhesion motif RGD.Activity: Also showed anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activity (Ren et al., 2018).Found also in barley and wheat. Found in multiple species. Updated 11/2023",
