    "Literature": "Discovery: isolated from bacteria.Chemical modification:  Methyllanthionine rings between residues 1 and18 as well as between residues 5 and 11; a lanthionine occurs between Cys14 and residue 4. In addition, addition of Lys19 to dehydralanine at position 6 forms a lysinoalanine bridge. The Asp residue at position 15 is hydroxylated.Activity: weakly active against B. subtitlis (inhibition zone).MOA:bacteria: Duramycins and cinnamycin specifically binds to phosphatidylethanolamine, thereby indirectly inhibiting the activity of phospholipase A2.Structure: Structure was studied by NMR (Zimmermann et al., 1993).Updated 12/2024",
