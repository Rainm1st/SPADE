    "Literature": "Discovery: homologous search of the BRICHOS domain, cleavage site RR, followed by mature AMP.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (47.62%) toCT7R=C: 20%, Y: 15%, V=L=F: 10%. GRAVY: 0.625; mol wt: 2562.158; mol formula: C116H178N32O25S4; mol ex coeff: 4720.Activity: active against E. coli ML-35p or ESBL 521/17  (MIC 1-2 uM), A. baumannii 16.63 or 7226/16 (MIC 1 uM), P. aeruginosa MDR 522/17 (MIC 2 uM), K. pneumoniae ESBL 344/17  (MIC 2 uM), and S. aureus 1399/17 (MIC 1 uM).Toxicity: human RBC; HC30 >100 uM (less than 20% hemolysis at 100 uM, less hemo.lytic); PBMC: IC50 44.7 uM; A549/NHDF cells (IC50 >100 uM), K562 (IC50 72.1 uM), EA. hy926 (IC50 27.1 uM).MOA:bacteria:E. coli: membrane permeabilization.Structure: became a beta-sheet in micelles esp. SDS (CD 215 nm band), consistent with alpha-fold predicted beta-sheet structure stabilized by 2 disulfide bonds.Formatted 12/2024",
