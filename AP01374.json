  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Both TCs, but not neutrophil-activating peptide-2 and connective tissue-activating peptide-III, were bactericidal for B. subtilis, E. coli, S. aureus, and L. lactis and fungicidal against C. neoformans. Killing of B. subtilis by either TC appeared to be very rapid. Because TCs were unable to dissipate the membrane potential of L. lactis, the mechanism of TC-mediated killing most probably does not involve pore formation.",
