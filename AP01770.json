    "Literature": "Activity: Active against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and fungus C. albicans.Also exerted strong nematocidal activities against C. elegans.Toxicity: It showed weak hemolysis activity. Since piceain 1 contains three additional residues at the N-terminus, it remains to be established whether piceain 2 is a natural form or simply a derivative of piceain 1.Structure:  CD suggests a beta structure.
