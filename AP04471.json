    "Literature": "Discovery: a new LAB was found for production followed by 4-step purification (centrifugation, salt precipitation, chromatigraphic methods) of this bacteriocin from the supernatant.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (38.1%) toPlantaricin GZ1-27molecular mass of 5470.75 Da (about 50 aa). Warning: only the N-terminal 20 amino acids have been determined ny Edman degradation.  It is a small, proteinous compound and non lanthionine-containing peptide.Activity: warning: partially purified peptide inhibited the growth of A. tumefaciens, which causes crown gall disease (a plant tumor) and fungi  V. dahliae, which causes Verticillium wilt of olive.  Warning: other bacteria not tested.Antimicrobial robustness:  heat treatment: stable at 90oC for 1 h but  lost 40% activity at 100oC for 1 h and entirely inactive after autoclave (121oC for 15 min).  Antibacterial activity detected pH 2-10 and antifungal activity detected pH 3-9: best pH 4-7 for both microorganisms.  Activity lost after treatment with  proteases (e.g., proteinase K, trypsin and pronase E ).MOA:bacteria:A. tumefaciens: appeared to act on membranes.Plant protection:Olive: The combination of BacYB1 with the Biofertilizer Humivital (T8) group, protect plants olive against wilt disease induced by the phytofungal V. dahliae.",
