    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence  is 54.8% similar toscorpion Opiscorpine 1. Active against B. subtilis.  The C-terminal S-S-containing domain can block the K+ channel. Hge36, a naturally occurring N-terminal 28-residues truncated form, has also been found. It a noncytolytic blocker of potassium channels albeit with a more restricted spectrum and lower activity (Diego-García E et al., 2008). The N-terminal domain is not antibacterial. A man-generated form, HgeD, corresponds to residues 33-76. The structure of the truncated forms of has been determined (Flores-Solis D et al., 2016). Updated 4/2017.",
