    "Literature": "Discovery: genome mining with antiSMASH and BAGEL4. Biosynthetic gene cluster: romA: the precursor peptide;  romBTC: biosynthetic genes; romRK: regulatory genes; romFEG: immunity genes, romP: maturation protease.Chemical modification:  3 amino acids dehydrated (XXW): T2, S5, and T18; four thiether rings (XXT): 3 and 8, 8 and 11, 13 and 19, and 21 and 24.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this peptide is similar (54.84%) tonisin UThis peptide differs from nisin A by five amino acids, viz, P9A, K2I, A15V, L16I, and G18T, all located in rings B and C.Activity: inhibition zone: active against L. monocytogenes. MIC measured: L. lactis MG1363 (MIC 0.78 ug/ml), L. monocytogenes LMG10470 or TT82E or LK132 (MIC 12.5-25 ug/ml), B. cereus CH-85 (MIC 25 ug/ml), S. aureus LMG10147 or LMG15975 MRSA (MIC 100 ug/ml), and E. faecium LMG11423 or LMG16003 or LMG16216 (MIC 50-100 ug/ml) anti-VRE.Structure:  A structure similar to nisin A was proposed with lipid II binding domain at the N-terminus and a pore-forming domain at the C-terminus. Diffrent from numerous known nisins collected in the APD, however, this peptide is unique since it contains only four thioether rings due to a shorter sequence. The lack of ring 5 may be the main reason for reduced activity compared to nisin Z.MOA:bacteria: like nisin, this short peptide also binds to lipid II.Recombinant production:bacteria:Lactococcus lactis: nisBTC is first induced by Zn2+ to hydrate the peptide and Rombocin A was then induced by adding nisin. NisC is required to make the thioether rings.Peptide stability: (1) stable for 5.5 h at pH 2-10 (more stable than nisin at pH 7); (2) stable between 22-50oC; more stable to proteases (trypsin, chymotrysin, and proteinase K) than nisin Z. These features make rombocin a promising candidate to be engineered into a new food preservative.SAR: the following changes (A9P, M20NMK, and K25A) reduced peptide activity, while a change I12 to K (I12K) increase peptide activity. The I12K mutant is called Rombocin K (see next APD entry). Est.Jan2024;",
