  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Enterococcus faecium L50 produces enterocin L50 (L50A and L50B) (EntL50, EntL50A and EntL50B), enterocin P (EntP) and enterocin Q (EntQ) and displays a broad antimicrobial spectrum against the most relevant beer-spoilage lactic acid bacteria (LAB) (i.e., L. brevis and P. damnosus), which is mainly due to the production of EntL50 (EntL50A and EntL50B). Int J Food Microbiol. 2008 Jul 31;125(3):293-307. EntQ is a plasmid-encoded peptide, which is produced between 16-47oC and maximally accumulated at 47oC.  Recombinant peptide is active against E. faecium P13 (Criado R et al., 2006). Updated 3/2017.",
