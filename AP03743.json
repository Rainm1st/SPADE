    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (63.64%) toMicrocin J25Chemical modification: G1 and E8 sidechain forms an amide bond, leading to a lasso structure locked by C-terminal aromatic F and Y.Activity: active against S. infantis (MIC 0.04 uM), S. sonnei (MIC 0.4 uM), S. flexneri (MIC 20 uM), B. subtilis (MIC 0.05 uM), P-aeruginosa (MIC >20 uM), C.perfringens (MIC 200 uM), S. aureus (MIC 0.2 uM), E.coli (MIC 200 uM), and K.pneumoniae (MIC 200 uM).Resistance mechanism: An A63G point mutation of the iron receptor protein fhuA and early termination at 182 or 643 gave rise to 1000-fold increases in MccY resistance.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli:. \nAlso Recombinant production:bacteria:Bacillus subtilis: improved expression with peptide yield 1.481 uM MccY (Zhang et al., 2023).",
