  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "It shows 75% sequence similarity to pep5. Three thioether rings are proposed. The biosynthetic gene cluster of this lantibiotic includes eciI, eciA, eciP, eciB, and eciC. These genes are sufficient for heterologous expression in Staphylococcus carnosus TM 300.  The successful expression to some extent can also be attributed to the reduced activity of this peptide compared to pep5.",
