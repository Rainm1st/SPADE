    "Literature": "Discovery: identified genetically from skin secretions followed by chemical synthesis.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (95.83%) toBrevinin-1DY1L: 21%; A: 17%; I: 13%. GRAVY: 1.14; M Wt:  2614.304; Mol formula: C123H206N30O27S2; molar extinction coeff: 125.Activity: active against Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 6538 or MRSA NCTC 12493 (MIC 32 uM), E. faecalis NCTC 12697 (MIC 32 uM), Gram- E.coli ATCC 8739 (MIC >512 uM), K.pneumoniae ATCC 43816 (MIC >512 uM), P.aeruginosa ATCC 9027 (MIC >512 uM)), C.albicans ATCC 10231 (MIC >512 uM). It killed S. aureus at 2xMIC in 180 min. It also showed biofilm inhibitory activity (MBIC 32 uM) but was unable to disrupt biofilms (MBEC > 256 uM). This peptide inhibits cancer cell proliferation.Structure: random coil in 10 mM NH4Ac buffer, but became helical (33.73%) in 50% TFE.MOA:bacteria: the peptide was able to permeate S. aureus membranes.Toxicity: the peptide is toxic: hemolytic HC50 23.96 uM: highly hemolytic. Also HACaT cells (IC50 44.09 uM) and HMEC (IC50 32.96 uM).",
