    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (39.3%) toCitrocin.Activity:  Active against B. cepacia ATCC 25416 (MIC 4 uM) and B. multivorans ATCC 17616 (MIC 31 uM), causative agents of lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. Spot on lawn active against also B. mallei Old ISU and B. mallei NVSL 86-567â€“562. Also active against B. cenocepacia AU0756 (MIC 0.25-0.5 uM) and B. cenocepacia AU24326 (MIC 2 uM) (Ref see SAR).MOA:  Ubonodin inhibits E. coli RNA polymerase (RNAP).Expression: PupB is identified as the ubonodin outer membrane (OM) receptor (Do et al., 2022).Structure:You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.SAR: a library of over 90 000 ubonodin variants with amino acid substitutions was expressed in Escherichia coli. One variant H17G was found to have improved activity (MIC 0.125-0.25 uM) against a clinical isolate of the Bcc member B. cenocepacia (Thokkadam et al., 2023).Reg. 2/2020; updated 7/2022; 3/2023",
