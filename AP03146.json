  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (57.5%) tohSAA2.Activity:  More active against E. coli and S. aureus at acidic pH 5.5. An incubation with 2.5 uM peptide reduced bacteria by 90%. Deletion of SAA1/2 in mice impaired the clearance of S. aureus in the skin. The bacterial killing of SAA at acidic pH was achieved via membrane binding and disruption (Zheng et al., 2019).",
