  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Nukacin 3299, produced by Staphylococcus simulans 3299, is identical to nukacin ISK-1 (Ceotto H et al 2010 Vet Microbiol). It is active against staphylococcal strains involved in bovine mastitis, M. luteus DSM 1790, and S. aimulans 22 (Roy U et al., 2014). Nukain ISK-1 competes with nisin, suggesing a similar mode of action, leading to a thin cell wall (Asaduzaman 2009 AAC). This peptide inhibits cell-wall biosynthesis, accumulating lipid II precursor inside the cell, and the peptide activity can be repressed by lipid I and lipid II (Islam 2012 JACS). Partial known sequence of Warnericin RB4 matches nukacin ISK-1, suggesting a possible identical peptide also produced by Staphylococcus warneri RB4 (Curr Microbiol. 2005).  Found in multiple species.
