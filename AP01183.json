  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Of those 21 strains, a representative bacteriocin of strain VRE82, designated bacteriocin 43, was found to be encoded on mobilizable plasmid pDT1 (6.2 kbp) (plasmid-encoded). The predicted mature BacA protein (44 amino acids) showed sequence homology with the membrane-active class IIa bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria and showed 86% homology with bacteriocin 31 from E. faecalis YI717 and 98% homology with bacteriocin RC714.",
