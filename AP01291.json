  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "The peptide has been reported in different articles in different names. In addition to antimicrobial activity, the peptide also inhibits trypsin due to the disulfide-bonded trypsin inhibitory loop in the sequence (enzyme inhibitor) (Li J et al 2007 FASEB J 21: 2466-73). In this proteomic paper, 372 cDNA sequences of antimicrobial peptides were found in a single frog. Among them, 107 are new peptides. Approximately 40 peptides were synthesized and tested. Only 24 peptides with antimicrobial acitivities (APD entries 1291-1314) were registered into this database. Active against active against E. coli (MIC 3.2 ug/ml), S. aureus (MIC 5.8 ug/ml), B. subtilis (MIC 1.85 ug/ml), and C. albicans (MIC 2.4 ug/ml). Derivatives: ORB-C (sequence CWTKSIPPKPC, disulfide bridged) has improved trypsin inhibition ability but lost its antimicrobial activity. ORB1 is N-terminal AA truncated form. Updated 7/2021",
