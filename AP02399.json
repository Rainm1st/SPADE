    "Literature": "SIL is secreted by S. iniae into the extracellular milieu. Although it displayed antibacterial activity against B. subtilis, SIL showed no effect on 22 other Gram+ and Gram- bacteria tested. It can attach to the B. subtilis surface without killing (bacteriostatic). Activity is lost by heating at 50oC (heat-sensitive). SIL may serve as a virulent factor for infection. This dual role as antimicrobial and immune modulator suggests that a good understanding of the functions of an AMP is essential.  Updated 8/2014.",
