  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE shows 86% similarity toA. dichotoma defensin.  Active against S. aureus. A syntheic peptide corresponding to the 9 residues close to the C-terminus (AHCLAICRK-NH2) is active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Five more 9mers were made and are also active. These peptides show no hemolytic activity and did not inhibit the growth of murine fibroblast cells or macrophages. However, AWLLAIRKR-NH2 is toxic.",
