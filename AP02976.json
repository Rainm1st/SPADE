    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 47.2% similarity toDistinctin.Activity: Active against bacteria mainly Gram- E. coli (MIC 32 ug/mL), P. aeruginosa (MIC 64 ug/mL) and fungi C. albicans (MIC 64 ug/mL). Also inhibits proliferation of cancer cell lines such as H157, and PC3, but with little toxicity against normal human cell, HMEC-1.Predicted to be helical. The active region is located at the N-terminus of the peptide. Updated 7/2021",
