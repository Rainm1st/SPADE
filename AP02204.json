  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Chemical modification:  Warning: the sequence is a close mimic of the natural peptide antibiotic. In the natural form, there are multiple Dab (2,4-diaminobutanoic acid), which are represented here as lysines. The molecule is cyclic due to the formation of an amide bond between the amino group of Dab in position 4 and the carboxyl group of the C-terminus. Residue Leu6 is a D-amino acid and the N-terminus is attached by a fatty acid (Polymyxin E1= colistin A: fatty acid A=6-methyloctanoic acid; Polymyxin E2=colistin B: fatty acid B=6-methylheptanoic acid).Activity: active agianst Gram- bacteria A. baumannii or 18 Acinetobacter spp. isolates (MIC50 < 1 ug/ml), 13 E. coli strains (MIC50 < 1 ug/ml),  8 Enterobacter spp. isolates (MIC50 <1 ug/ml), 16  K. pneumoniae strains (MIC50 < 1ug/ml), 33 P. aeruginosa strains (MIC50 2 ug/ml), 17 S.maltophilia  strains (MIC50 128 ug/ml) (Tan and Ng, 2006), but not S.aureus.  Some Gram- strains are AMP-resistant.MOA:bacteria:  It preferentially binds to LPS of Gram-negative bacteria and disrupts membranes (Moser et al., 2014).  Because of such interesting properties, there is interest in developing polymyxin analogs.Resistance development:yes:bacteria:A. baumannii ATCC 19606: multiple strains have been found to show resistance to colistin (e.g.,Li et al., 2006).Resistance mechanism: Escherichia coli (chromosomeor plasmid-mediated mcr gene, PhoP-mediated resistance observed in Resistance development:yes:bacteria:P. mirabilis, Resistance development:yes:bacteria:E. coli, Resistance development:yes:bacteria:P. aeruginosa, and Resistance development:yes:bacteria:K. pneumoniae (Osisiogu et al., 2024). Multiple processes are involved for resistance development with mutations at at least five loci (Jochumsen et al., 2016).In vivo PK:mice:IV: t1/2 37.1 min in plasma; when administered intratracheal, t1/2: 23.4 (2.64 mg base/kg) and 34.5 min (5.28 mg base/kg) (Lin et al., 2017).Synergy:drug: antiparasitic drug Niclosamide showed synergistic activity with colistin against Colistin-Resistant A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae (Ayerbe-Algaba et al., 2018).AMPs in use:  Colistin sulfate:  for oral and topical use. Sodium colistimethate (CMS): for parenteral and inhalation routes. CMS is a prodrug which converts to colistin in vivo. It is less potent and less toxic.  Colistin, used alone or in combination, is important to treat Gram-negative infections such as CF involving P. aeruginosa.  Polymyxins also promote the release of histamine and serve as safe mucosal adjuvants that enhance vaccine-induced antigen-specific immune responses (for example ovalbumin intranasally immunized mice;Yoshino N et al., 2013).Toxicity:   nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. N-succinylation had only a minor effect on on peptide accumulation related to toxicity (Milman & Dahlager, 1978).Updated 1/2014; 8/2015; 11/2015; 4/2017; 12/2017; 2/2020; 10/2024; 12/2024; Jan2025",
