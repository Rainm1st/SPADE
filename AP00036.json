    "Literature": "naming:  Initially called bovine neutrophil beta defensin 1 (BNBD-1).Chemical modification:  3 disulfide bridge: 5, 34; 12, 27; 17, 35.Activity: Active against a fresh clinical isolate of E. coli from bovine mastitis milk. Diffusion assay S.aureus (not active 300 ug/ml). However, it had very weak activity against clinical mastitis isolates of S.aureus and S.uberis in 10 mM NaPO4 buffer  (MIC data provided by Chunfeng Wang). Updated 9/2017; 7/2021; formatted 9/2024",
