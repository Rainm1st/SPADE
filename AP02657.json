  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide most resembles (89.7% similarity)Cycloviolacin O12.  Mol. Wt: 2866.3; GRAVY=0.317. Active against cancer cells: Hela. MOA: the peptide induces apoptosis by releasing cytochrome C and activating caspases in cervical cancer cells.  This is one of the 13 cyclotides found previously by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry (Hashempour et al., 2013).",
