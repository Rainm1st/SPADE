    "Literature": "Structure: It contains three disulfide bonds.Activity: Active against E. coli (see ref). Also killed S. aureus based on virtual colony count assays (9.8 ug/ml killed 99.9%). This method exposed bacteria to peptides for 2 h in 10 mM phospahtate buffer before incubating in media for 12 h (Wang et al., 2023). Updated 7/2021, 2/2023",
