    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (77.78%) toApidaecin IBP: 33%, R: 28%.Activity: it inhibited E. coli BL21 (MIC 8-16 uM) in RPMI/serum or TSB and MIC>64 uM in LB. Activity in LB < RPMI < TSB. It appears that this Pro-rich peptide is more active in the TSB medium. Warning: Other bacteria not tested.",
