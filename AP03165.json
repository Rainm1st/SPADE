  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (43.6%) toTurgencin A.Chemical modification:  Six cysteines has an unusual disulfide connectivity of Cys1-Cys6, Cys2-Cys5, and Cys3-Cys4 and an amidated C-terminus. Variation in peptide oxidation (M) has been observed. 67% Mox0, 29% Mox1, 4% Mox2. The first methionine is preferentially oxidized.Structure:  NMR analysis reveals a possible C1-C6/C2-C5/C3-C4 disulfide pattern. It is likely that the peptide has some helical feture because both sample heterogeneity and peptide conformational dynamics caused a problem.Activity:  Active against C. glutamicum (MIC 1.6 uM), B. subtilis (MIC 1.6 uM),  E. coli (MIC 12.5 uM ), P. aeruginosa, A2058 (MIC 25 uM). Highly toxic to the human melanoma cancer cell line A2058 (IC50 4.1 uM).Toxicity:  it is also highly toxic to non-malignant human fibroblast cell line MRC-5 (IC50 7.5 uM). However, Turgencin BMox2 (97% Mox2, 3% Mox1) is much less active and toxic, indicating a loss of activity due to oxidation. And M oxidation number and site also matter.APD comment: Thus, peptides containing methionine may be poor drug candidates.",
