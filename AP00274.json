    "Literature": "Activity: Active against Gram- E.coli (MIC >500 uM), P.aeruginosa (MIC> 500 uM), P. vulgaris (MIC 54.6 uM), K.oxytoca (MIC >500 uM), Gram+ S. aureus (MIC 0.19 uM), M.luteus (MIC >500 uM), fungi C.albicans (MIC > 500 uM), C. kefyr (MIC 18.6 uM), and C. tropicalis (MIC 19.4 uM) (See ref AP00729, Tam JP et al. PNAS 96:8913-8).  It also inhibited HIV-1 infection in cultured human T-lymphoblast (CEM-SS) cells (EC50 40-260 nM) and cytotoxicity (TC50 500 nM), therapeutic index (2-12)(Ireland et al., 2008).Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-sensitive:P. vulgaris (100 mM); NaCl-sensitive:S. aureus (100 mM); NaCl-sensitive:C. kefyr (100 mM); NaCl-sensitive:C. tropicalis (100 mM).Structure:   It is cyclic and contains three disulfide bonds: 1,17; 5,19; 10,24. The 3D structure displays a clear amphipathic feature, which may be responsible for antimicrobial activity (Daly NL et al. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285:333-345).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. In contrast, the molecular surface of the squash trypsin inhibitor MCoTI-II is entirely charged and it did not show antimicrobial activity (Heitz et al 2001 Biochemistry 40: 7973-7983).Updated 7/2021; 11/2023",
