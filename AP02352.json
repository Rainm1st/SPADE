  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Three forms were found. The three forms share the same peptide sequence (corresponding to residues 173-194 of chromogranin A) but differ in chemical modifications (P, G, and PG for phosphorylated, glycosylated, and phosphorylated-glycosylated form, respectively).  Active against M. luteus strain A 270. Updated 4/4/2014.",
