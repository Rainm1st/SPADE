  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 45% similarity tohBD-26Mol Wt:  10009.806; GRAVY: -0.326. Different from classic human beta defensins, this peptide contains one additional long C-terminal tail for glycosylation that confers negative charge to the surface of the sperm, essential for its maturation and effective transport in the female reproductive tract (Tollner et al., 2011). Deletion mutants are unable to increase sperm motility (Aram et al., 2020). For a review, please refer toTollner et al., 2012).Activity:  The core defensin region (sequence:  NWYVKKCLNDVGICKKKCKPEEMHVKNGWAMCGKQRDCCVPAD) was recombinantly expressed in 2013 and found to have antimicrobial activity against E. coli K12D31, S. aureus CMCC 26003, and C. albicans SC 5314 (see the ref). This form also has moderate LPS binding ability, thereby anti-inflammatory in nature.Recombinant production:bacteria: the peptide has been expressed in E. coli. Updated 2/2020",
