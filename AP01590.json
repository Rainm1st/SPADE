  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery:  Thought to be orthologue of hBD-1 (~60% similarity). The native pBD-2 has NOT been purified yet, so it's unclear to what extent the synthetic peptide corresponds to the in vivo form. Also of note is that the synthetic peptide does not have S-S bonds.Activity: This synthetic peptide is most active against S. typhimurium in vitro and in vivo, L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, and E. rhusiopathiae. pBD-2 (4-8 uM) killed these pathogens within 3 h. antiinflammatory activity may result from a direct interaction of pBD-2 with TLR-4 rather than LPS binding.Antimicrobial robustness: Antimicrobial activity reduced in the presence of 150 mM NaCl (salt-sensitive).MOA:bacteria: Also active against S. aureus by targeting membranes. It also binds DNA based on gel retardation expt (Zhang et al. 2020).Structure: CD suggests both alpha and beta structure.animal model:pig: Overexpression of this peptide in pigs made the animals more resistant to A. pleuropneumoniae InfectionYang X et al., 2015. animal model:mouse: PBD-2 Overexpression Protected the Mice From S. Typhimurium Infection (Huang et al., 2019).UPdated 6/2014; 12/2015; 8/2020; 10/2023.",
