  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: Astacidin 1 is produced by a proteolytic cleavage from hemocyanin under acidic conditions. The processing and release of astacidin 1 from hemocyanin is enhanced when crayfish are injected with lipopolysaccharide or glucan.Activity:  Active against S. flexneri ATCC 203 (MIC 15 uM), P-vulgaris OX19 ATCC 6380 (MIC >20 uM), E. coli D21 (MIC 15 uM), P-aeruginosa OT 97 (MIC >20 uM), B. megateriun B11 (MIC 1.9 uM), B. subtilis ATCC 6633 (MIC 15 uM),  S-aureus Cowan 1 or JC-1 (MIC >20 uM), and M. luteus M1 11 (MIC 12.8 uM).Warning: a synthetic form did not show the exactly same activity spectrum as the native peptide. The reason is not clear yet.Structure:  CD suggests a beta structure (spectrum ?).",
