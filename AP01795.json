    "Literature": "Orthologue of hBD-2. Located on chromosome 8. mRNA detected in several tissues (see Source). Three disulfide bonds are C9-C37, C16-C30, and C20-C38. When expressed as a fusion protein, mBD-4 showed activity against both E. coli (MIC 1 ug/ml) and S. aureus (MIC 1 ug/ml) as well as chemotactic activity via CCR6-expressing cells (Rohrl J et al. J Biol Chem. 2010 Mar 5;285(10):7028-34). Updated 3/2014; 3/2017; 6/2023.",
