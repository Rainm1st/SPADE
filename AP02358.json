    "Literature": "Discovery: Initially discovered in 2000 (Zheng XC, et al., 2000). The C-terminal region of BmKbpp (BmKbpp-C) shows 72% similarity to the peptide K-12, a bradykinin-potentiating peptide. BmKbpp markedly inhibits the superoxide production in granulocytes or HL-60 cells at the concentrations of submicromolar level.Activity: Antimicrobial activity was demonstrated in 2012 (see the ref). Active against Gram-negative bacteria E. coli DH5-alpha (MIC 2.3 uM), H. influenzae ATCC 31517 (MIC 3.2 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC 13882 (MIC 2.8 uM), S. enterica ATCC 8090 (MIC 2.3 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 9229 (MIC 4.7 uM), S. marcescens ATCC 13880 (MIC 68.2 uM), Gram-positive bacteria B. subtilis ATCC 6051 (MIC 24.4 uM), L. monocytogenes ATCC 35152 (MIC 5.7 uM), M. luteus ATCC 9341 (MIC 20.3 uM), E. faecalis ATCC 14508 (MIC 57.1 uM), N-asteroides ATCC 3308 (MIC>70 uM), and S-aureus ATCC 14458 (MIC>70 uM).  Also, the peptide is active against fungi, including N. crassa FGSC 2489 (IC50 2.0 uM), B. cinerea ATCC 28387 (3.1 uM) and F. culmorum ATCC 32973 (0.2 uM).Toxicity: It caused 39.9% hemolysis (hRBC) at 50 uM, moderate hemolytic.
