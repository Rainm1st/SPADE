    "Literature": "Activity: It showed a good activity against E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 5.7 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (15 ug/ml), and C. albicans (MIC 8 ug/ml), weak activity against L acidophilus NCTC 1723 (MIC 74 ug/ml), and very weak activity against S. mutans NCTC 10449 (MIC 171 ug/ml).  NMR characterization in bicelles revealed a multiple turn structure or 3(10) helix (Gayen A et al 2011 Biochim Biophys Acta 1808:127-139). The bicelle-derived structure of substance P as a neurotransmitter was docked into the NK1R receptor. Updated 6/27/2011; 5/9/2014.",
