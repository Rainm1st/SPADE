  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: Isolated in 1939, it is the first peptide antibiotic used clinically but it is only used topically (AMPs in use).Chemical modification:  Synthesized non-ribosomally by a multienzyme complex. Both the N- and C-termini are chemically modified (CHO at the N-terminus and NHCH2CH2OH at the C-terminus). N-terminus is rich in Val, while the C-terminus is rich in Trp. Amino acids 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 are D-amino acids.Structure in lipid bilayer:  It forms a special helical structure followed by head-to-head dimerization into a cation channel in lipid bilayer with the C-terminus exposed (Ketchem RR et al 1996 J Biomol NMR 8: 1).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.  Structures solved in organic solvents by x-ray diffraction are believed to be non-channel forms.Activity: This peptide shows effects on HIV and HSV infections (Arch Virol 1997; 142: 2225-35). gA also has anticancer effect.MOA:cancer:  It downregulates EGR4 expression, inhibits cholangiocarcinoma cell growth through EGR4 (early growth response protein 4), and  induces necroptotic cell death (Gong et al., 2020).Updated 2/2012; Jan2018; 6/2019; Jan2020; 7/2020; formatted 5/2024.",
