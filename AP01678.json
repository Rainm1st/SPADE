    "Literature": "Warning: Only the N-terminal sequence of this 9 kDa LTP is available.  Cc-LTP1 exhibited strong antifungal activity, against C. albicans, and also promoted morphological changes including the formation of pseudohyphae on Candida tropicalis, as revealed by electron micrograph. It is also able to inhibit mammalian alpha-amylase activity in vitro. Updated Jan2017.",
