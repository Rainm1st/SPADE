    "Literature": "History: Initially discovered by Gibson BW, Poulter L, Williams DH in 1985 without known activity (Gibson et al., 1985).Activity: Activity was demonstrated in 1988 (see ref). Active against E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 6-25 uM), P.aeruginosa ATCC 27883 (MIC 200-500 ug/ml), S. aureus ATCC 25923 or MRSA (MIC 25-50 uM)c, S. pyogenes ATCC 19615 (MIC 10-50 ug/ml), S. cerevisiae ATCC A3180, and C.albicans (MIC 100-200 ug/ml). protozoan P. caudatum (minimal disruptive conc MDC 5 ug/ml), A. castellani (MDC 2 ug/ml), and T. pyriformis (MDC 20 ug/ml).  Active against Gram+ A. viridans (MIC 0.6-1.2 uM), M. luteus (MIC 0.3-0.6 uM), B. megaterium (MIC 1.3-2.6 uM), B. subtilis (MIC 0.6-1.3 uM), S. aureus (MIC 1.3-2.6 uM), P. acidolactici (MIC 1.3-2.6 uM), Gram- E. coli (MIC 1.3-2.6 uM), S. typhimuriumn (MIC 5.2-52 uM), K pneumoniae (MIC 1.3-2.6 uM), E. cloacae (MIC 1.3-2.6 uM), E. carotovora (MIC 1.3-2.6 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 5.2-52 uM) (see ref for Thanatin). Active against B. dendrobatidis (Table 1, Rollins-Smith, BBA 2009; 1788:1593-1599).  ALso active against Gram+ B. cereus (MIC 2.3-4.6 uM), B. thuringiensis (MIC 4.6-46 uM), C. michiganensis (MIC 1.15-2.3 uM), Gram- P. cepacia, P. syringae, P. syringae pv. syringae,  P. syringae phaseoli (MIC 1.15-2.3 uM), P. pisi (MIC 0.6-1.15 uM), P-maculicola, P-valerianella (MIC >30 uM), X. campestris pv. oryzae (MIC 4.6-46 uM), X. campestris pv. campestris (MIC 0.3-0.6 uM), X. vesicatoria 687.3, and X. vesicatoria B229RI (MIC 0.6-1.15 uM) (Ehret-Sabatier et al., 1996).Structure: helical structure in DPC.Synergy:AMPs: Magainin 2 and PGLa, isolated from the skin of the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis, show marked functional synergism (Westerhoff HV et al. 1995 Eur J Biochem 228:257-64; Rollins-Smith LA et al. 2002 Dev Comp Immunol 26:63-72; Biochemistry. 2007;46(49):14284-90).Toxicity:  little hemo.lytic (7%) till 1000 ug/ml (cf. mellitin showed 100% lysis at 50 ug/ml).
