GRAVY: -0.75; mol Wt: 3759.176; mol formula: C153H241N43O54S5; mol ex coeff: 3292.5.Activity: 39% growth inhibition of C. albicans was not peptide-dose dependent from 25 to 200 ug/ml. C. buinensis inhibition 37% at 100 ug/ml and 70% at 200 ug/ml.   no effect on C.tropicalis or C.parapsilosis at 200 ug/ml. cell viability loss when treated at 200 ug/ml (53 uM) for 24 h:  C. albicans and C. buinensis. CaCPin-II inhibited alpha-amylase activity.Toxicity:  28% hemolysis at 200 ug/ml (53 uM). toxic to mammalian cells.",
