In contrast, CATH1-3 and 5 did not show any detectable activities against all the tested microorganisms even at the concentrations up to 200 ug/ml.Expression:RT-PCR: Ps-CATH4 was the only one expressed in all tested tissues, including lung, spleen, liver, kidney, muscle, stomach and intestine. after A. hydrophila challenge, the transcriptional level of Ps-CATH4 in lung was up-regulated by 10.5-fold at 24 h post-infection (most significant among these peptides).
