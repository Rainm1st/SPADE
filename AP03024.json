  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 38.6% similarity toCqCrs.Activity: Active against B. megaterium (MIC <0.8 uM), S. aureus (MIC <1.6 uM), and B. subtilis (MIC <3.1 uM), Gram-negative bacteria V-parahaemolyticus, V-alginolyticus, V-harveyi and E-coli (MIC >25 uM). Warning: text/table inconsistency: > or < in table but not in the text. The peptide is also able to agglutinate Gram+ bacteria (bacteria-agglutinating).Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: the peptide has been expressed in bacteria. Updated 8/2019; 7/2021",
