  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (90.48%) toArenicin-1R: 29%, V: 24%, A=Y: 14%.Activity: active against E. coli (MIC 4.0 uM) and L. monocytogenes (MIC 3.6 uM). The MIC values are comparable to Ar-1 (3.3 and 2.2 uM, respectively).In vitro toxicity: minimal hemolytic concentration (MHC) 11.1 uM, which is higher than that of Ar-1 (MHC 2.9 uM).SAR: linearization of  the peptide via iodoacetamidated cysteine did not affect peptide activity clearly but lienar peptide appeared to be less toxic (Orlov et al., 2019).",
