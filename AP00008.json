    "Literature": "Activity:  Active against B. megatherium Bml 1 (MIC 11 uM), B. subtilis Bs11 (MIC 17 uM), and M. luteus Mill (MIC 20 uM) (provided by Chunfeng Wang).Antimicrobial robustness:  KCl-sensitive:E. coli: 100 mM salt MIC increased 4 fold.Derivative: A S-S bond led to a CYCLIC DODECAPEPTIDE, which is more active against gram- bacteria. Only linearized versions of the peptides (Bac2A, obtained by converting the two Cys residues to Ala residues, plus C-terminal amidation) showed activtiy against Gram+ bacteria such as S. epidermidis and E. facaelis. The linearized or reduced forms appeared to be more effective in dissipating the membrane potential (Wu M and Hancock,RE 1999 JBC 274: 29-35).MOA:bacteria:  Like NaD1, Bac2A is unable to disrupt SUVs and interacts with intracellular targets yet to be identified (van der Weerden et al. 2010 JBC 285:37513-20).Synergy:AMPs: This peptide displayed synergistic effects with indolicidin (entry 150) against E. coli (Yan H & Hancock REW 2001 Antimicrob Agents Chemother 45: 1558-60). IDR-1018 has wound healing capability. APD Updated Jan 2011; 4/2016; 9/2017; 7/2023.",
