    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (46.15%) toPG-LMol. Wt:  1049.197; GRAVY: 0.609; Mol Formula:   C46H76N14O14; mol ex coeff: 0.Discovery:screened LAB strains isolated from the tilapia intestine.Activity: inhibited S. flexneri strain 14 (MIC 12.65 ug/ml) S. flexneri_14 growth. It also has antibiofilm activity. It also inhibits the growth of S. aureus 26 and E. coli 02.Antimicrobial robustness: activity is susceptible to proteases; gradually decreased with increase in pH (73.74% at pH 12); retained 56.06% antibacterial activity at 121oC. The effect is killing.MOA: treatment with the peptide caused the release of K+, ATP, and LDH, membrane active. It binds genomic DNA as well (Xin et al., 2023). e2/2023.",
