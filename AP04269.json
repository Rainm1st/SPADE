    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (85.71%) toScorpion\tHp1404K: 29%, L=G: 14%.Activity: active against Gram- E. coli AB94012 or ATCC25922 (MIC 25-50 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa AB93066 or ATCC9027 (MIC 50 ug/ml),  Gram+ S. aureus AB94004  or ATCC25923 or MRSA P1381 or MRSA P1374 (MIC 6.25-12.5 ug/ml). Also active against C. albicans ATCC 10231 or CMCC 98001 or AY 93025 and 5 clinical strains (MIC 15.5-62 uM). inhibits C. albicans hyphal formation and formation of biofilms:Fungi:C. albicans at 50 ug/ml (Shui et al., 2024).MOA:fungi:C. albicans: permeabilized fungal membranes. induced ROS as well.Structure:  helical in 50% TFE.Toxicity: human RBC: HC50: >>400 ug/ml, ~10% hemo.lytic at 400 ug/ml (similar to L1K8, least in the series). Also less toxic to HFF (IC50 100-200 ug/ml) and HEK293T (IC50 ~100 ug/ml) cell lines than WT.Resistance development:no:bacteria:S. aureus AB94004: after 15 passages, but kanamycin and ampicillin did (Li et al., 2016).Animal model:mouse: Wound healing: K1K8 also decreased methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacterial or fungal C. albicans counts in the wounded region in a mouse skin infection model. Antifungal results are reported in the 2024 ref above.Updated 12/2024",
