    "Literature": "37% similar to Warnericin RK (AP2104). Mass difference suggests post-translational modification fo this peptide yet to be determined.Activity: Active against L. plantarum, L. monocytogenes, B. subtilis, M. luteus, P. putida, and E. coli. The peptide activity was lost by treatment with pepsin and proteinase K (62%) but not affected by lipase or alpha-amylase. Registered 9/1/2014.",
