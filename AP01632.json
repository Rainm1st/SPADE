  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "This peptide antibiotic showed antimicrobial activity against M. luteus (MIC 0.2 ug/ml).Chemical modification: Cypemycin does not contain lanthionine bridges but exhibits some of the structural features of lantibiotics, notably 4 dehydrated threonines (dehydrobutyrines, Dhb) and a C-terminal S-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl]-d-cysteine. Cypemycin also possesses two l-allo-isoleucine residues and an N-terminal N,N-dimethylalanine, both unique amino acid modifications. Different from lantibiotics, Cys19 (not Ser) is dehydated and forms a ring structure with Cys22 (Claesen J and Bibb M 2010 PNAS 107:16297-302).Natural variant: Grisemycin, with three residues 5-7 deleted, has been found, but its antimicrobial activity against M. luteus was not detected even using concentrated supernatant (J Bacteriol. 2011 May;193(10):2510-6).
