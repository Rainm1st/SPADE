    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is highly similar (93.62%) toHill-Cec11previously reported from the same insect. H2 differs from Hill-Cec11 at N-terminus with one additional R and C-terminus with additional QG.Activity: Peptide H2 is active against E. coli ATCC25922 (MIC 0.8 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC700603 (MIC 6.6 uM), A.baumannii ATCC19606 (MIC 6.6 uM), P-aeruginosa CMCC10104(MIC >26.2 uM), V. parahaemolyticus ATCC17802 (MIC 0.8 uM), E-faecalis ATCC29212 (MIC >26.2 uM), B. subtilis BNCC109047 (MIC 6.6 uM), S-epidermidis ATCC35984 (MIC >26.2 uM), S-aureus ATCC6538 (MIC >26.2 uM), and C-albicans ATCC10231 (MIC > 26.2 uM).Antimicrobial robustness:  NaCl-insensitive:E. coli (150 mM); CaCl2-insensitive:E. coli (2 mM);  KCl-insensitive:E. coli (4.5 mM); serum-insensitive:E. coli (10% fetal bovine serum).",
