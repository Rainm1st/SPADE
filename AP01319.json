  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "This is the first report of a functional beta defensin that possesses only 5 cysteines (rather than the canonical 6). It displayed activity against S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and B. cepacia, indicating the canonical 3-pairs S-Sbonds are not a must (Taylor K et al. 2007 Antimicrob Agents Chemother 51: 1719-1724).",
