    "Literature": "AMP Significance: associated with Parkinson's disease. Amyloid AMPs.Sequence analysis: APD analysis revealed a net charge of -9, out fo the core region. Molecular formula:  C627H1015N163O216S4; Mol Wt 14460.151; GRAVY=  -0.40; Wimley-White whole-residue hydrophobicity of the peptide:  62.61 kcal/mol.Activity: Active against bacteria E. coli (MIC 0.2 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 0.2 uM), S. aureus (MIC 0.2 uM), S. epidermidis (MIC 0.2 uM), yeast C. albicans (MIC 0.4 uM), C. tropicalis (MIC 0.4 uM), F. neoformans (MIC 0.8 uM), mold A. flavus (MIC 0.8 uM), A. fumigatus (MIC 1.6 uM), A. parasiticus (MIC 1.6 uM), R. solani (MIC 3.2 uM), and T. harzianum (MIC 3.2 uM).SAR: The activity is mainly located at the N-terminal region: 1-60 is active and residues 1-95 are even more active (net charge +3, hydrophobic%, 43%; GRAVY, 0.15; Boman index, 0.56). It is located on bacterial surface and likely targets membranes.Structure: The PDB link is a micelle-bound structure.You can rotate, zoom, and view the lipid II bound 3D structureherein the PDB.Updated Jan2018; 3/2018; 12/2024.",
