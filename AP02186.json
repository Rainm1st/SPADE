    "Literature": "Antimicrobial activity: Active against C. albicans, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, S. mutans, S. pyogenes, and S. aureus (IC50 0.4-3 uM).Salt-sensitive: Activity is salt-sensitive.SAR: The C-terminal 28-aa peptide of human CCL28 also displayed a selective candidacidal activity. It is also active against parasite L. mexicana in vitro (SÃ¶birk SK et al 2013).Structure: The 3D structure of CCL-28 has been determined by NMR spectroscopy. Three beta strands and two helical region were found. The C-terminal region is disordered (Thomas MA et al., 2018).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.
