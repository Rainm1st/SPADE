    "Literature": "Horseshoe crabs are located within the subphylum Chelicerata, while crabs belong to the subphylum Crustaceans (Tor Haug).Discovery: extracted from hemocyte debris twice with 30% acetic acid. The dried material was then chromatographed.Activity: Active against E. coli (IC50 25 ug/ml), S. aureus (IC50 4.2 ug/ml), C. albicans (IC50 3.0 ug/ml) and P. pastoris (IC50 0.5 ug/ml).Structure: 3 disulphide bridges: 4,24; 11,29; 23,41.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. For NMR assignments, see BMRB 5268.MOA: Tachystatins were found to bind chitin (fungi cell wall component), which may be related to antifungal activity. Residue Phe9 can be essential for chitin binding (Jujitani et al. 2002 JBC 277: 23651-7).  7/22/2010; 2/2014, merged with AP1008 4/2019; 6/2020; 2/2023",
