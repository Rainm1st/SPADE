    "Literature": "Activity: Active against (kill) P. haemolytica (MBC50 20 uM), K.pneumoniae ATCC 10031 (MBC50 0.62 mM), E.coli ATCC 12795 (MBC50 0.64 mM), S.aureus ATCC 29213 (MBC50 1.21 mM), and S.faecalis ATCC 29212 (MBC50 1.39 mM) in Zinc-containing buffer 0.14 NaCl/10 uM ZnCl2 (see ref). A recent study tested additional bacteria and found this peptide was inactive (MIC> 512 ug/ml). These include E.faecium BAA-2317, S.aureus ATCC 43300, K.pneumoniae 700603, A.baumannii 19606, P.aeruginosa 27853, E.coli ATCC 25922 and C.albicans 10231 (Miller et al., 2023) (Provided by Adriana Miller).MOA: This anionic antimicrobial peptide requires Zinc as a cofactor to kill bacteria (Miller et al., 2021). Ovine serum contains 15 uM zinc. In contrast, phosphate inhibits antimicrobial activity of SAAP.SAR: Bactericidal activity (i.e., MBC50) against P. haemolytica increases with a decrease in the number of aspartate residues in the peptide.
