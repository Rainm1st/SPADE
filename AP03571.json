    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (46.15%) toMastoparan-VT2L=K=22%; others: 11% each; Mol. Wt: 1081.388; GRAVY: 0.1; Mol Formula:   C48H88N16O10S1; mol ex coeff: 0.Activity: E. coli (MIC 8-16 ug/ml) and S-aureus (MIC > 64 ug/ml).SAR: C3L and C3R variants are losing activity (MIC>64 ug/ml). However, H2L variant is more active against E. coli (MIC 4-8 ug/ml) and S. aureus (MIC 4-8 ug/ml). There was little effect when H2 was changed to R. A 9-mer peptide was found to be antibacterial.
