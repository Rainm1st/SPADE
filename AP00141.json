    "Literature": "Chemical modification:  N-terminal acetylation and C-terminal amidation.Activity: active against P. digitatum PHI-26 (MIC 20 uM), P. italicum PHI-1 (MIC 40 uM), P.expansum CMP-1 (MIC > 160 uM), B. cinerea CECT2100 (MIC 60 uM), F. oxysporum CECT2866 (MIC 80 uM), S.cerevisiae W303-1A (MIC > 160 uM), and E.coli DH5alpha (MIC 160 uM). Also active against S. aureus ATCC25923 (MIC 30 uM), E. coli O29 (MIC 20 uM), Group B Streptococcus A909 Ia (MIC 10 uM) in 20% TSB, C. albicans ATCC14053 (MIC 30 uM), M. furfur ATCC46267 (MIC 20 uM) in 20% Dixon, A. niger (MIC 20 uM), N. otae CECT2797 (MIC 30 uM), T. mentagrophytes CECT2958 (MIC 20 uM),  and T. rubrum (MIC 20-30 uM) in 20% culture/60% PBS (non-standard assay) (López-García et al., 2007).MOA: This cell penetration peptide shows concentration-dependent mechanisms in killing fungi, energy dependent at low concnetration (2-5 uM) but energy indepedent at 20 uM (Muñoz A et al., 2012).Resistance mechanism: mprF or dlt deleted S. aureus strains are more sensitive to killing.Entry history:  A previous entry was replaced Feb 2010.
