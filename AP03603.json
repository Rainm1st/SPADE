  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (93.33%) toHuman CalciterminA:33%; H=K: 13%.Activity: At pH 7.4, it was not active. At pH 5.4, the peptide and its zinc and copper complexes were active against C. albicans 10231 (MIC 1 ug/ml). Zn2+ or Cu2+ has little effect on antifungal activity (MIC 0.5-2 ug/ml). Inactive: E.faecalis 29212 (MIC>128 ug/ml), S.aureus 29212 (MIC>128 ug/ml), E. coli 25922 (MIC > 128 ug/ml), K.pneumoniae 13883 (MIC >128 ug/ml), and P.aeruginosa 15442 (MIC>128 ug/ml). In the presence of Zn2+, weak activity was observed against S. aureus (MIC 64 ug/ml).Structure: CD spectroscopy measurements show an alpha-helical secondary structure in 10 mM SDS. The peptide is able to bind Zn2+ and Cu2+ ions based on potentiometric titration, mass spectrometry, UV-Vis absorption and NMR studies.Deposited by Denise Bellotti 3/2023.",
