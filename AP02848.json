    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide shows 64% similarity toChrysophsin-2.  molecular formula:  C120H198N38O24; Mol Wt 2557.135; GRAVY=  0.79; Wimley-White whole-residue hydrophobicity of the peptide: -1.22  kcal/mol.Activity: Active against E. coli, S. aureus (MIC 10-20), V. parahaemolyticus, and P. pastoris (MIC 2.5-5 uM). Remarkably, it is also active against fish parasite C. irritans in the infective stage (so called “white spot disease” or “cryptocaryoniasis”). Upregulated after V. Parahaemolyticus challenge.",
