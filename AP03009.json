  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "AMP significance:Lucilia eximiahas been used principally as alternative species for maggot therapy in Central and South America. The discovery of this AMP explains in part the therpeutic use of this insect in wound healing.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 95% similarity toLSer-Cec1 FROM Lucilia sericataMol Wt:  4285.995; GRAVY: -0.28; Mol ex coeff. 5550; mol formula: C189H325N58O54. 10% V, 12% A, and 12% K. Predicted to be helical.Activity: Active against E. coli DH10B (MIC 7.8 ug/ml) and E. coli ESBL (MIC 15.6 ug/ml). Inactive: E.cloacae (MIC 125ug/ml). MBC similar.Toxicity:  Not toxic to vero cells and not hemo.lytic at 250 ug/ml, but it displayed some toxicity to PBMCs (IC50 58.3 ug/ml). It showed immunomodulatory effect on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by reducing LPS-induced TNF-alpha release when treated at 17 ug/mL (anti-inflammatory) and induces cell migration of Hacat at 5 and 50 ug/mL (chemotactic).  7/2021; 7/2023",
