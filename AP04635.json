  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (61.54%) toKR-12K: 33%, L=I=R: 17%.Activity:  active against Gram- E. coli KCTC 1682 (MIC 4 uM), P. aeruginosa KCTC 1637 (MIC 8 uM), S. typhimurium KCTC 1926 (MIC 4 uM), Gram+ B. subtilis KCTC 3068 (MIC 4 uM), S. epidermidis KCTC 1917 (MIC 1 uM), and S. aureus KCTC 1621 (MIC 4 uM). Warning: Non-standard assay.The peptide can also bind to LPS and show an anti-inflammatory effect (e.g., suppressing TNF-alpha).In vitro toxicity: human RBC (HC50 96 uM).Structure:  random coil in 10 mM PBS and helical in 0.1% LPS.SAR: D-amino acid incorporation into KR-12-a5 at positions 5, 6, or 7  induced a significant improvement in therapeutic index by 3.8- to 13.9-fold as compared to KR-12-a5, while maintaining the anti-inflammatory activity. Only the position 7 change also altered peptide structure in the presence of 50% trifluoroethanol, SDS or LPS.Updated 7/2024",
