    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 76.9% similarity tofish Epinecidin-1. Mol Wt:  2985.646; GRAVY: 0.236.Activity:Active against E. coli (MIC 2.5 uM), S. aureus (MIC 1.25 uM), and V. parahaemolyticus (MIC 1.25 uM). MBC values are the same same MICs.Structure: Both a short form and a longer form are helical, implying Em-Pis1M (mature form) is also helical. Updated 7/2021",
