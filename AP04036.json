    "Literature": "AMP significance: A common polymorphism in RNASE6 compromises Its antimicrobial activity toward uropathogenic E. coli.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (99.21%) toRNase 6L: 36%; K: 36%.Activity: this single-residue variant (MBC75 8.22 uM) is less active against E. coli than the WT (MBC75 2.08 uM). MBC100 > 20 uM against other strains.SAR: This variant also has reduced antibacterial activity (e.g., E. coli), LPS binding and bacteria-agglutinating ability compared to the WT with an arginine at position 66 (MAC 1.38 uM; cf. WT 0.22 uM). MAC=minimal agglutination concentration. In contrast, this change did not harm catalytic activity.Est.Jan2024;",
