    "Literature": "This sfTSLP is the predominant form of TSLP. The sfTSLP form showed poor similarity (30.4%) TObacterial Enterocin EJ97Activity: Compared to the long form, which was also reproted to be antimicrobial mainly against Gram- bacteria (Sonesson A et al., 2011), this short form TSLP (sfTSLP) exhibited a markedly stronger antibacterial activity against B. cereus, E. coli, E. faecalis, S. mitis, S. epidermidis, and C. albicans. (Incubate 2 h followed by plating count).SAR:  MKK34 (sequence: MKKRRKRKVTTNKCLEQVSQLQGLWRRFNRPLLK), another fragment of TSLP, is also antimicrobial in the presence of human plasma and at physiological salt conditions.
