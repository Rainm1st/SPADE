  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "The synthetic form of the peptide is C-terminally amidated (Personal communication). Likely to form a helical structure based on helical wheel projection. The peptide showed good activity against G+ bacteria such as M. Luteus AB93113, B. thuringiensis AB93066, S. aureus AB94004, B. subtilis, including MRSA with MIC in the range of 20-50 ug/ml). Antimicrobial activity of this peptide was also demonstrated in vivo using an animal model:mouse infected with S. aureus.  Updated 5/4/2012GW.",
