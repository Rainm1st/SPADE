  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: The sequence of this peptide differs from MesY105 (APID: 00635) by only two residues.Activity: Active against L. sakei subsp. sakei CIP 103139 (MIC 8 nM), E. faecium HKLHS (MIC 256 nM), L. lactis CIP 102422 (MIC 1.02 uM),  L. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides CIP 102305 (MIC 128 nM), L. innocua CIP 80.11 (MIC 64 nM), L. ivanovii subsp. ivanovii CIP 78.42 (MIC 32 nM), L. monocytogenes CIP 82.110 (MIC 16 nM), and S. pneumoniae CIP 102911 (MIC 256 nM). leucocin A-UAL187, leucocin A-QU15, leucocin B-Ta11a, and leucocin B-KM432Bz share the same mature amino acid sequence (Makhloufi KM et al., 2013).MOA:bacteria: Note that the D-enantiomer is inactive, suggesting a receptor target?? The activity of leucocin B-KM432Bz requires subunit C of the EIIt Man mannose permease, which is the receptor for entry into target cells.Structure: The N-terminal residues 2-16 forms a s-stranded beta sheet. One alpha helix from 18 to 29; one disulfide bridge 9,14.  3D structure was determined by Fregeau Gallagher NL et al. (Biochemistry 1997; 36: 15062).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.  Found in multiple species. Updated 3/2014.",
