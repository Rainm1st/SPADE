    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (88.89%) toCopN5(22â€“30)L=K=22%; others: 11% each; Mol. Wt: 2096.799; GRAVY: 0.87; Mol Formula:   C96H182N28O19S2; mol ex coeff: 0. CopA3 (LLCIALRKK-amide)2 is a designed disulfide-linked dimeric peptide.Activity: active against Gram- E. coli (MIC 16 uM), K. pneumoniae (MIC 16 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 32 uM), Gram+ E. faecalis (MIC 2 uM), E. hirae (MIC 4 uM), S. aureus (MIC 8 uM), S. epidemidis (MIC 8 uM), and yeast C. albicans (MIC 8 uM). The peptide is also active against bacteria, even in the biofilms(Curr Microbiol. 2012).  The peptide is also antibiofilmB (Hwang et al., 2013). It has anticancer activity (gastric cancer cells) as well (Lee et al., 2015). Jan2023",
