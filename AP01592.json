  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Recombinantly expressed fusion form was active against E. coli K12. The gene was originally detected and reported by Li P et al. 2001 Science 291: 1783-1785. Bin1b mRNA was only found in epididymis. Its expression started 30 days of age, reached a miximum during the sexually  mature period, and decresed with age. Thus, this AMPappears to be important for host defense in the reproductive system.",
