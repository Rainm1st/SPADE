  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Proteins and peptides were isolated from crushed seeds by acidic extraction followed by acetone precipitation and fractionation using a variety of liquid chromatography methods. 45.9% similar toEcAMP2isolated from the same plant. Also similar to plant EcAMP1, MBP-1, and Tk-AMP-X2.Activity: EcAMP3 is active against plant fungal pathogens, including F. graminearum (IC50 5.5 uM), F. oxysporum (IC50 9.6 uM), A. niger (IC50 22.4 uM), and B. sorokiniana (IC50 15 uM). The peptide can be cleaved by trypsin.",
