    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (76.5%) toTemporin-SHd. The sequence was originally discovered in 2010 (see temporin-SHd). Helical after bound to anionic lipids. This 2020 paper now establishes that temporin-SHe is indeed an AMP, primarily active against Gram+ bacteria.Activity: Active against Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. aureus ATCC 43300,  S. aureus ATCC BAA-44, S. aureus ST1065 (MIC 3.1 uM), L. ivanovii (MIC 5 uM), E. faecalis ATCC 29212 (MIC 12.5 uM), B. megaterium (MIC 1.6 uM), Gram- E. coli ATCC 25922, E. coli ATCC 35218, E. coli ML-35p (MIC 25-50 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 60 uM), A. baumannii ATCC 19606 (MIC 25 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883, S. enterica (MIC 100 uM), yeast C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019 (MIC 50 uM), S. cerevisiae (MIC 12.5 uM), and C.albicans ATCC 90028 (MIC >100 uM). Temporin-SHe demonstrated dose-dependent anti-Leishmania effects against promastigote forms\n(insect stage) of L. infantum, L. braziliensis, and L. major (IC50 4.6-11.5 uM).Toxicity:  It showed 84% hemolysis at 25 uM, highly hemolytic.
