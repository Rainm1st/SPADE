  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: identified via sequence alignment with his-rich peptides. MUC7 itself is not antifungal. The protein could be cleaved in saliva.  Exposure of MUC7 with whole saliva results in rapid degradation of protein. However, the protein is slowly cleaved by C. albicans, leading to detectable fragments.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (37.5%) toHcl-hst5R=H: 33%, E: 13%. GRAVY: -3.25; mol wt: 2099.272; mol formula: C85H135N41O23; mol ex coeff: 0.Activity: active against C. albicans (ED50 39.95 uM).Chemical modification: the peptide activity reduced after N-terminal Acetyl or Succinyl addition, but retained some activity after Octanoyl (ED 50 41.9 uM). C-terminal amidation increased peptide activity (ED50 16.52 uM). The effects on C-terminally amidated form are the same due to N-terminal acetyl, succinyl, and octanoyl.Structure:  random coil in water and helical in 80% TFE (CD and NMR).",
