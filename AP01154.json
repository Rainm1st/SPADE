  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "inhibits the plant pathogens, Xanthomonas and Pseudomonas. Although no S-S bonds, it is reported to have retained >80% activity even after 20 min of heating at 80oC. The thermodynamic stability of LCI is believed to be conferred by the aromatic stacking interactions, cation-p interactions, and aromatic-backbone amide interactions. Structure has been determined (Biochemistry. 2011 May 10;50(18):3621-7).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.  80% of the aromatic residues and ~86% of the  cationic residues reside in the C-terminal 26-residue stretch. The C-terminal  26-residue fragment (amidated) is antimicrobial. LCI22-47 is active against E. coli (MBC= 2 uM 100% killing), gentamicin and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (gentamicin-resistant MRSA) (MBC 4 uM), and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) (MBC 4 uM).
