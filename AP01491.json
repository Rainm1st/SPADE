  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Contains multiple Tyr.Host expression: very low level without infection. Peptide-encoding genes induced after D. coniospora infection. AMP expression here is not TLR dependent (only one Toll: TOL-1). Rather, it is controlled by tir-1, which  is required for full resistance to infection.Activity: it had antifungal activity against D. coniospora, N. crassa (MIC 6.25-12.5 uM), and A. fumigatus (sporulation inhibition at 3.1 uM).  It also had modest antibacterial activity against the Gram+ M. luteus (MIC 5.7-11.4 uM) and Gram- E. coli (MIC 22.7-45.4 uM).AMP Significance: reducing nlp-31 expression by RNAi did not have a notable effect on the survival of worms after D. coniospora infection, indicating multiple factors are involved. Moreover, the expression of this NLP-31 reporter was not induced\nby heat shock or starvation. UPdated 7/2021",
