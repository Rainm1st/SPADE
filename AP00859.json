    "Literature": "C-terminal NH2. It only showed weak activity against B. megaterium. Temporin H increased permeability of the E. coli inner membrane although unable to lyse the bacteria. Thus, this may assist the entry of other small hydrophobic compds into bacteria (Eur. J Biochem 2000; 267: 1447-1454).  UPdated 5/2020",
