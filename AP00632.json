    "Literature": "Activity: Active against L. monocytogenes 4A.Chemical modification: There is a disulfide bond.Stability: Piscicolin 126 proved to be stable to high temperatures at acidic pH values. However, it was inactivated at neutral or alkaline pH values.Food preservation test: inclusion of piscicolin 126 in a commercial ham paste preparation inhibited the growth of L. monocytogenes for up to 14 days of storage at the abuse temperature of 10oC, better tnan nisin.
