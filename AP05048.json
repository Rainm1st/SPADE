  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is 97.5% similar toAP138L-arg26C: 15%, G: 20%.Activity: active against S. aureus MRSA ATCC 43300 and 8 clinical isolates (MIC 2-16 ug/ml), S. agalactiae and S. epidermidis. Warning: other bacteria not tested.Antimicrobial robustness: Peptide is active in 25% plasma (MIC 4 ug/ml):plasma-insensitive, NaCl-insensitive:S. aureus (150 mM), KCl-insensitive:S. aureus (2.5 mM), CaCl2-insensitive:S. aureus (2.5 mM), MgCl2-insensitive:S. aureus (2.5 mM).Structure:  beta structure in water due to disulfide bonds and more ordered in SDS micelles.Resistance development:yes:bacteria:S. aureus: S. aureus MRSA developed resistance to this peptide slightly after 30 passages. MIC increased 4 fold.Synergy:antibiotics: it worked with ceftiofur sodium synergistically (FICI: 0.3125).In vitro toxicity: not hemo.lytic (<1%) till 256 ug/ml. At 256 ug/ml, it showed subtle toxic effects on mouse macrophages RAW264.7 (78% survival) and uterine epithelial cells BNCC 359233 (85% survival).In vivo toxicity:mice:  7 days daily IP injection  at 10 mg/kg, not toxcity sign was observed based on body weight, cell counts, and histology.Animal model:mouse: treated at 5 mg/kg, survival rate 100% higher than ceftiofur sodium antibiotic (75%).  peritonitis: Reduced CFU in animal organs (i.p./i.p.).  It also showed anti-inflammatory effects by supressing TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6.Recombinant production:yeast:Pichia pastoris: the peptide can be expressed and purifed.Updated 12/2024",
