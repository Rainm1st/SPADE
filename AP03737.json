    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (97.5%) toDLP4a single amino acid variant of DLP4, K32G. C: 15%; R: 10%; G: 13%. GRAVY: -0.04; Mol W: 4203.96; Mol formula: C175H287N60O48S6; Mol Ex coeff:  5925.Activity: Active against Gram+ S. aureus CVCC 546 (MIC 0.95 uM), S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC 1.91 uM), S. pneumoniae CVCC 2350 (MIC 0.95 uM), and S. suis CVCC 3928 (MIC 0.95 uM), stronger than the WT DLP4 (see AP2548). Not good at Gram- E-coli ATCC 25922 or K88 (MIC >30.5 uM),  S. pullorum CVCC 533 (MIC >30.5 uM), and S. enteritidis CVCC 3377 (MIC >30.5 uM, i.e., >128 ug/ml).Toxicity: little hemo-lytic (0.4% hemolysis at 128 ug/ml, 30 uM).Structure: a negative band at ~215 nm, indicating a beta structure.MOA:bacteria: membrane permeation.Animal model:mouse: Mouse Thigh Infection Model, infected with S. aureus CVCC 546, 2 h later, treated a single IP dose with 10 mg/kg, 1.8 log CFU decrease.Anti-inflammatory: a significant downregulation of serum levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-10 by 1123.30 pg/mL, 750.02 pg/mL, and 37.66 pg/mL, respectively.",
