    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (92%) tohuman cathelicidin fragment LL-23GRAVY:  -0.752; M. Wt: 3064.697; Mol formula: C142H239N41O34; Mol Ex Coeff: 0;pathogen cleavage: This peptide is an intermediate Candida albicans cleaved product. It can be cleaved into even smaller fragments by secreted aspartic proteases, leading to total inactivation of LL-37.Activity: LL-25 is even more active against C. albicans than its parent peptide LL-37 (activity data not reported). However, LL-25 lost imumune regulatory activity.",
