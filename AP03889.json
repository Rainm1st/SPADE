    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is poorly similar (92.31%) toDFT561. L: 62%.Chemical modification:  C-terminal amidation.Activity: Active against S. aureus USA300 (MIC 6.2 uM), P-aeruginosa PAO1 (MIC > 25 uM), E-coli ATCC 25922 (MIC> 25 uM), and K-pneumonia ATCC13883 (MIC > 25 uM).Toxicity:  human RBC HC50 >300 uM, much less hemo.lytic.Structure:  NMR studies revealed helical structure bound to SDS micelles.Animal model:mouse:  In contrast to DFT503 and DFT561, DFT564 and DFT565 didn't show systemic in vivo efficacy due to high cationicity (i.p./i.p.).",
