  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "The sequence of the chain b (PlnK) of this two-chain bacteriocin is RRSRKNGIGYAIGYAFGAVERAVLGGSRDYNK. PlnK or PlnJ was found to adopt a helical structure in DPC micelles or in TFE. A 1:1 ratio of PlnK and PlanJ is at least 1000 times more active than the individual peptide.  Active against P. pentosaceus Pac 1.0 (MIC 50 nM), L.  plantarum 965 (MIC 0.1 nM),  L. sake NCDO 2714 (MIC 50 nM), and L. viridescens NCDO 1655 (MIC 5 nM).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure bound to DPC micellesherein the PDB.
