    "Literature": "Discovery: the first AMPs isolated from sea urchins. isoform 1b not isolated.Activity: Active against Gram- L. anguillarum serotype O2 (MIC 2.5 uM), E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 5.0 uM), Gram+ C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 (MIC 2.5 uM), and S. aureus ATCC 9144 (MIC 2.5 uM). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was set at the lowest concentration of peptide reducing the OD to less than 50% of the growth control.Toxicity: not hemolytic at 17.5 uM.Updated 7/2021; 11/2023",
