  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: leaderless, i.e. no signal peptide. The amino acid sequence of enterocin 7A is identical to that of MR10A. Also, DdA is also found to have the identical sequence to Ent7A and MR10A (Rabia Ladjouzi et al. 2020). However, enterocin 7A is N-terminally formylated, a feature of leaderless peptide (Liu X et al., 2011). The sequence of chain b (MR10B; Enterocin 7B) is MGAIAKLVAKFGWPFIKKFYKQIMQFIGQGWTIDQIEKWLKRH. Found in multiple species.Structure: Remarkably, the peptide is helical in aqueous solution (Lohans CT et al., 2013).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.
