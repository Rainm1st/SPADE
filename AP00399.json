  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Structure:  CD studies revealed a helical structure in TFE, SDS, and DPC micells. In SDS, the helix was mapped to residues 4-23 by NMR.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Derivative:  A fragment corresponding to residues 2-21 was found to have similar structure and activity (Lee KH et al. 2003 Biochem Biophys Res Commun 309: 591-7). However, the peptide adopted a slightly bent helical structure in 50% TFE (Landon C et al. 2006 Biopolymers 81: 92-103). Similar bent helices were observed for LL-37 (entry 310) and magainin 2 (entry 144).Virus: inhibited Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 HIV-1 (EC50 3.05 uM).Toxicity: TC50 >33.3 uM in CEM-SS cells.  (Wang, G et al., 2010 Antimicrob Agents Chemother 54: 1343). Updated 2/2012; 2/2014 GW.",
