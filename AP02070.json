    "Literature": "Activity: Active against Gram-positive L. monocytogenes, L. innocua, and E. faecalis. It interacts with peptidoglycan carbohydrate. This protein is essential in keeping bacteria away from ~50 micrometer zone that separates bacteria from the small intestinal cell surfaceScience 2011.Regulation of expression:immune-cell-specific an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activity is necessary for normal expression of REG3G in all regions of the small intestine (Chakraborty et al., 2024). STING controls the expression of this peptide in intestine, thereby playing a critical role in homeostasis. Inhibition of STAT3 pathway and glycolysis suppressed STING-induced REG3gamma production in IECs, and abrogated STING-mediated IEC killing of C. rodentium(Yu et al., 2020). Also, commensal bacteria Ruminococcus gnavus and Limosilactobacillus reuteri can induce its expression (Ramirez and Surana, 2023). The TLR adaptor protein My88 is required.
