  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "The core sequence prior to modification is 65% similar toLabyA2.Chemical modification: LabyA1 contains a special amino acid labionin at positions 1, 4, 8, 10, 13, and 19. Labs 1,4 and labs 10, 13 are connected via a carbon-carbon bond, while labs 4, 8 and labs 13, 19 form normal thioether bonds. In addition, a disulfide bond occurs between C9 and C20.Activity: It possesses a broad-spectrum anti-HIV and anti-HSV activity against various strains in different cell lines (EC50 0.8-3.3 uM). labyrinthopeptins A1, the prototype congeners of carbacyclic lanthipeptides, inhibits the proliferation of diverse enveloped viruses, including dengue virus, Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus, hepatitis C virus, chikungunya virus, Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus, in the low micromolar to nanomolar range (Hans Prochnow et al., 2020).Updated 7/2021",
