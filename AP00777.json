    "Literature": "C-terminal NH2, this NRC seris of peptides was identified by gene analysis and biological activity verified using synthetic peptides. This family of flatfish antimicrobial cationic peptides share common signal and proregion sequences\nbut differ in their core antimicrobial sequences.  Active against A. salmonicida 99-1,  A. salmonicida 97-4 (MIC 64 uM),  S. enterica serovar Typhimurium MS7953s (MIC 16 uM), S. enterica serovar Typhimurium 14028s (MIC 16 uM), P. aeruginosa Z61 (MIC 32 uM), E. coli CGSC4908 (MIC 32 uM), E. coli UB1005 (MIC 32 uM), E. coli DC2 (MIC 32 uM), S-epidermidis C621 (MIC>64 uM), methicillin-resistant S-aureus C623 (MIC>64 uM), C. albicans C627 (MIC 64 uM).
