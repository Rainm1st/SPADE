    "Literature": "Peptide design: designed using magainin-2 as a template. 20 residues are decided to pass lipid bilayers. Virtual screen of 50,000 peptides generated based on the observed amino acid frequencies of all alpha-helical peptides in the APD2 database.Nomenclature: peptide was named after the C-terminal segment LAVRA.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (40.91%) toHistone H2B-1(HLP-1). Synthetic peptide is C-terminally amidated. K: 15%; A: 20%; V=L: 10%. GRAVY: 0.295; M Wt: 2247.704; M formula: C108H172N27O25, mol ex coeff: 7040.Activity: active against E. coli DH5alpha-GFP strain (MIC 50 uM) and S. aureus SH1000-GFP strain (MIC 50 uM).Toxicity: no lysis of human dermal microvascular endothelial (HDME) cells at 100 uM. But killed Michigan cancer foundation 7 (MCF-7) cells at 50 uM.Structure: both CD and NMR were used. Residues 8-18 are helical in TFE by NMR.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.",
