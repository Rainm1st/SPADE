    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (50%) toPelophylaxin-4G: 13%; L: 19%; K: 13%; R: 13%; Mol formula:  C88H142N27O20; Mol Wt: 1897.252; Mol Ex Coeff: 5550; GRAVY: -0.34.Activity:  active against C. albicans AY93025, C. albicans ATCC 10231, C. albicans CMCC 98001, C. albicans, 5 C. albicans clinical resistant strains (MIC 26.4-52.7 uM). It reduced biofilms as well.MOA:  It increases ROS levels in the yeast cell. It also disrupts mitochondrial membrane potential. Phibilin could induce C. albicans necrosis.Structure:  helical in 25-75% TFE.DNA binding:  It interacts with DNA based on gel retardation experiment.Toxicity:  not hemo.lytic till 400 ug/ml. Not toxic to HEK293 or A549 cells till 200 ug/ml.Animal model:mouse:  skin: fungus injected into the back skin and 1 h later injected with 50 ul (500 ug/ml) peptide at the infected site, once daily for 3 days. 2 logs CFU drop was observed.",
