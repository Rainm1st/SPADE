    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of  defensin 1 shows 50.7% similarity toinsect Tenecin 1.Activity: E. coli  Active against S. aureus MW2, USA100, USA300, USA400, RN4220, Newman, and clinical isolates including BF1,BF5, BF7 to BF11 and S. epidermidis 9142 (MIC 16-64 ug/ml). Of the 23 AMPs tested, only this peptide is effective against S. pneumoniae D39 (Lindhauer et al., 2019).Synergy:AMPs:  It showed synergistic effects with telavancin (synergy2) and daptomycin (synergy1).Antimicrobial robustness: Activity can be compromised by salts: NaCl-sensitive:S. aureus MW2 (50-100 mM); CaCl2-sensitive:S. aureus MW2 (1.25-100 mM).Animal model:Caenorhabditis elegans: it showed dose-dependent protection of animal survival against MRSA.Updated 10/2019; 4/2025",
