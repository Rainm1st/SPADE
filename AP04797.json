  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (80.77%) toTAT-KR-12R: 38%; K: 17%.Activity: active against E. coli (MIC 12.09 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 6,12 uM), S.aureus (MIC > 320 uM).Similar to KR-12, the peptide is also anti-inflammatory by supressing the cytokine levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 from PS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. cf. CPP is unable to do so.MOA:bacteria:E. coli: MOA:bacteria:P. aeruginosa: membrane permeation.peptide formulation:Silica precipitation:CPP-KR12@Si: both KR-12 and CPP-KR12 are able to precipitate silica to form silica particles, allowing controlled delivery. The peptide retained its activity against Gran-negative bacteria and became more active against S. aureus after formulation.",
