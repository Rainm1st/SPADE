  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: Previously, KR-12 (AP00608, 12 amino acids) was identified as the minimal antibacterial peptide of human LL-37 (Wang, 2008). Recently, an even smaller antibacterial peptide called RIK-10 (10 amino acids) has been found in human LL-37 (see the ref). Note taht an even smaller peptide KR-8 was active only in diluted MHB (see the ref). Interestingly, all these \"minimal\" antibacterial peptides are derived from the major antimicrobial region (GF-17) of LL-37.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (58.82%) toGF-17. K: 19%; F=L=R: 13%. GRAVY: -0.08; M Wt: 1273.544; M formula: C58H101N17O14, mol ex coeff: 0.Activity: Active against E. coli (MIC 16 uM) but not S-aureus USA300 (MIC > 64 uM) in MHB.",
