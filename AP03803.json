  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: a truncated N-terminal fragment (residues 2-38) of Bac5 was found from bovine spleen neutrophils.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (86.05%) toBac5. P: 49%; R: 22%; F: 14%. GRAVY: -0.8; M Wt: 4480.486; M formula:  C222H333N61O39, mol ex coeff:  1490.Activity: Active against S. enterica serovar Typhimurium CMCC50097 or CVCC541 (MIC 8.33-16.77 ug/ml), E. coli ATCC25922 (MIC 33.33 ug/ml), S. pullorum BNCC124693 (MIC 25 ug/ml), S.aureus ATCC25923 (MIC > 200 ug/ml), and S. epidermidis (S. albus) CMCC26101 (MIC 50 ug/ml). Mainly active against Gram- bacteria (Yang et al., 2020).Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: an IPTG-induced SUMO-fusion expression system has been established. The recombinant peptide is released from fusion protein via SUMO cleavage.  (Xu et al., 2023).",
