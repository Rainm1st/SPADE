  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "It is accepted that A Gratia first documented antibacterial activity in 1925 (C.R. Soc. Biol. 93: 1040-1). It was named as colicin in 1949 (Fredericq P et al 1949 C.R. Soc Biol 143: 556-9). In 2007, it was re-named as microcin V (Duquesne S et al 2007 Nat Prod Rep 24: 708-34). MccV contains a single S-S bond between Cys76 and Cys87. MIC is remarkable in the range of 0.1 nM! MOA: It targets bacterial membranes and induces ion channel formation, leading to the disruption of the proton-motive force and hence ATP production.
