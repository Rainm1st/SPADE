    "Literature": "This study used the Lynn's definition (2004 Immunogenesis 56:170, where this peptide is called Gal7). In the recommended Xiao's nomenclature (2004 BMC Genomics 5:56), it is Gal4, which is also adopted by the APD.Synergy:AMPs: It showed synergistic effect with Gal 9 against S. enteriditis (Milona P et al. 2007 Biochem Biophys Res Commun 356: 169-74).",
