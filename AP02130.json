    "Literature": "Chemical modification:  The five disulfide bonds are proposed as Cys7-Cys55, Cys20-Cys32, Cys26-Cys38, Cys68-Cys80, and Cys74-Cys86 (Moulaei T et al Protein Sci 2012).Activity:  inhibited HIV-1, Ebola virus.MOA:virus:  It binds multiple mannose-rich glycans on HIV-1 gp120(Alexandre KB et al., 2013).Structure: a two-domain structure.You can rotate, zoom, and view the crystal structureherein the PDB.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: the peptide has been expressed in E. coli by fusing with thioredoxin. SD1(1-48) showed more anti-HIV activity than SD2 (49-95) (Xiong et al., 2006).bacteria engineering: Two different bacterial strains (Lactobacillus casei and Lactococcus lactis) were successfully engineered for scytovirin expression on the bacterial surface to neutrolize pseudotyped Ebolavirus in a cell-based assay (Wiggins et al., 2023).Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: pET32c(+) vector, fused with thioredoxin, His-tag, enterokinase digestion. Yield: 10 mg/L, which is higher than its fragments (Xiong et al., 2006).Updated 2/2014; 2/2025",
