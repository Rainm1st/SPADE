Garvicin Q Targets Man-PTS in a Broad Spectrum of Sensitive Bacterial Genera (Tymoszewska et al. 2017). The interaction between GarQ and Man-PTS may occur through a new binding pattern involving specific amino acids highly conserved among the GarQ-sensitive bacterial species located in the N-terminal part and extracellular loops of subunit IID and in transmembrane region of IIC.Recombinant production:bacteria:Corynebacterium glutamicum.
