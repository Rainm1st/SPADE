    "Literature": "Activity: Active against Gram- S. typhimurium LT2 and 1102 (MIC 3.1-6.3 ug/ml), E. coli K12 (MIC 12.5 ug/ml), S. Minnesota 1114W or R595 (MIC 3.1-12.5 ug/ml), Gram+ S. aureus 209P or ATCC 25923 (MIC 6.3-12.5 ug/ml), and C. albicans M9 (MIC 6.3 ug/ml).Chemical modification: Two disulfide bridges: 4,17; 8,13.Structure:  T22 is Tyr5,12, Lys7]-polyphemusin II. NMR study of T22 revealed anti-parallel beta structure (Tamamura H et al. 1993 Biochim Biophys Acta 1163:209-16). Other derivatives such as T131 and T140 are 14-residue analogs with imporved properties. Updated 4/2019; 7/2021",
