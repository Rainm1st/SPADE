  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (84.62%) totemporin FL: 31%, K: 23%, I: 15%.Activity: active against E. coli B21 (MIC 16 uM), E. cloacae beta12 (MIC 16 uM), P. aeruginosa PA14 (MIC 32 uM), S. epidermidis ATCC12228 (MIC 16 uM).Structure:  random coil in water and helical in SDS or TFE.Peptide stability:  it can be cleaved by proteases in 25% fetal bovine serum  in 6 h (FBS).In vitro toxicity:  HEMOLYTIC (HC50 ~30 uM). A further increase in basic amino acids led to an increase in toxicity.",
