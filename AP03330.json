    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (92.31%) toBrevibacillin VChemical modification: T1 dehydrated (Dhb); K3=Orithine, N-terminus is acylated with 2-hydroxy-3-methylvaleric acid (lipo); C-terminus is a characteristic valinol (an alcohol form of valine).Activity:  Active against Gram+ S. aureus ATCC15975 (MRSA) (MIC 2 ug/ml), E. faecium LMG16003 (VRE), E. faecalis LMG16216 (VRE), B. cereus ATCC14579 (MIC 2 ug/ml), Gram- A. baumannii ATCC17978 (MIC 32 ug/ml), E. coli ATCC25922 (MIC 16 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa LMG6395 (MIC 64 ug/ml), and K. pneumoniae LMG20218 (MIC 32 ug/ml).Stability: Bevibacillin 2V showed good stability in human plasma.MOA:  Binding to Lipid II (the GlcNAc-MurNAc moiety and/or the pentapeptid) and Permeabilizing Cellular Membranes of S. aureus (MRSA) (Zhao et al. 2021).toxicity:  not hemo.lytic to human RBC at 128 ug/ml. IC50 of HepG2 cells is 45.49 ug/ml. It is less toxic than other natural variants (Bre, Bre V, and Bre I: 5.21-9.89 ug/ml) because of the richness in valines. Updated 7/2021",
