    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (55.32%) toDLP4pI 7.05.Host expression:constitutive: A certain level of Smd1 transcript is found in the midgut constitutively.Activity: The HPLC fraction gave no activity at 8 uM. In the assay with lysozyme, however, it gave activity equivalent to 2.5 uM cecropin B, implying mainly a synegistic effect on E. coli (synergy:AMPs).  Updated 6/2019",
