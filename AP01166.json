    "Literature": "The structure of a novel insect peptide explains its Ca2+ channel blocking and antifungal activities. The arrangement of the three disulfide bridges in DSP was distinct from that of other antifungal peptides and conotoxins. The overall structure of DSP is compact due in part to the three disulfide bridges and, interestingly, is very similar to those of the insect- and plant-derived antifungal peptides. On the other hand, the disulfide arrangement and the three-dimensional structure of DSP and GVIA are not similar.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. Updated 2/2014.",
