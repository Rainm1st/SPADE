    "Literature": "EA-CATH2 was also isolated but antimicrobial activity was not evaluated. EA-CATH1 showed antimicrobial activtiy against most of the 32 strains of bacteria and fungi tested, probably targeting membranes. It appeared to be stable in serum and displayed no toxicity to human erythrocytes.",
