    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is poorly similar (43.33%) toGaegurin-RN4K: 20%, I: 16%, V=R: 12%.Activity: Active against Gram- bacteria E. coli 4 strains (MIC 3.125-6.25 ug/ml) and Gram+ S. aureus (reduced viability by 90%). It also aggregated E. coli (bacteria-agglutinating?).MOA:bacteria:E. coli: acted on bacterial membranes.Structure: random coil in buffer and helical in TFE (30%).In vitro toxicity: not toxic to mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells till 100 ug/ml.Other predicted peptides: four peptides predicted to be AMPs by online programs were synthesized and tested: three peptides showed MIC > 100 ug/ml and only this peptide is highly active.Entry history: AMP 2 (predicted) has been replaced. 12/2024",
