    "Literature": "Activity: Inhibited V. dahliae (IC50 5 ug/ml, MIC 15 ug/ml). Also inhibited the growth of a filamentous fungi, F. graminearum, A. solani. and F. culmorum at micromolar concentrations. Transgenic plants: expression of this peptide in patato improves resistance to pathogens (Gao AG et al., 2000;Abdallah NA et al., 2010). The C-terminal residues 31-45 contain the major antifungal determinants.MOA: A null mutation of the FgGCS1 gene encoding glucosylceramide synthase in fungi results in a mutant lacking glucosylceramide. The DeltaFggcs1-null mutant becomes resistant to MsDef1, suggesting that the peptide binds to glucosylceramide for toxicity against fungi (Mol Microbiol. 2007 Nov;66(3):771-86). MOA: MsDef1 blocks a mammalian L-type calcium (Ca2+) channel (Spelbrink RG et al., 2004). Reg. 8/2008; Updated 5/2014; 7/2015; 7/2021",
