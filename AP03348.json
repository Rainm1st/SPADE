    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (70.45%) toCL-defensinMol formula: C200H323N60O57S6; Mol Wt: 4697.504; Mol Ex Coeff: 7415; GRAVY: -0.144.Structure:  three disulfide bonds C1-C4, C2-C5, C3-C6. Predicted to be a CSalphabeta fold.Host expression: It is highly expressed at the nymphal stage and in adult tissues tested, the highest level was found in the fat body.Activity:  antibacterial assays conducted using both agar diffusion and microdilution assays. CcDef2 is active against Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC 0.92 uM), M. luteus CMCC 28001 (MIC 1.24 uM), and B. subtilis CMCC 63501 (MIC 1.56uM), but NOT Gram- bacteria, i.e., P.aeruginosa, E.coli, and S.typhi at the tested concentration (400 ug/ml).",
