    "Literature": "Structures in TFE and DPC were determined (Uteng M et al 2003 Biochemistry 42: 11417-26). The N-terminal region formed a 3-stranded beta sheet-like structure, while a well defined helical region was found between residues 18-33.  The beta-like structure and the helical region are not packed together.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. Updated 2/2014; 9/2021.",
