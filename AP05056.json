  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is 94.74% similar toHalocidinL: 26%, A: 16%, G=N=H=K: 11%. A lysine is added to the N-terminus of the wild type sequence and residues L3N4 were changed to KK. Warning: chain B sequence is the same as chain A.Chemical modification:  there is an intermolecular S-S bond between the two chains.Activity: active against S. aureus MRSA (MIC 4 ug/ml), B. subtilis KCTC 2213 (MIC 2 ug/ml), M. luteus KCTC 9341 (MIC 4 ug/ml), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strain CCARM 5028 anti-VRE (MIC 4 ug/ml), multidrug-resistant L. monocytogenes CCARM 2161 (MIC 4 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa CCARM 2161 MDRPA (MIC 4 ug/ml), E. coli KCTC 1039 (MIC 4 ug/ml), K. oxytoca KCTC 1686 (MIC 4 ug/ml), C. freundii KCTC 2359 (MIC 4 ug/ml), S. enterica KCTC 2930 (MIC 4 ug/ml), and  5 strains C. albicans (MIC 8-16 ug/ml).Peptide stability:  HG1 is resistant to proteases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, and MMP-7.  Also, activity is maintained in human wound fluids.",
