  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "AMP Significance: RNase 7 is induced (highest after 6 h post infection) in response to airway epithelial cells infection of M. tuberculosis (Mtb) (anti-TB), implying a role in anti-mycobacterial immunity (Torres-Juarez F et al., 2018). It is also found in human urinary tract (Spencer JD et al., 2011) and contributes to microbial defense. It is concluded that RNase 7 is the most abundant AMP in the human urinary tract (Zasloff M, 2013). Zasloff further commented that \"In my opinion, the studies of Spencer et al. have rewritten our current understanding of the antibacterial defenses of the human urinary tract\". Indeed,gene variant lowers peptide antimicrobial activity 2022.Activity: Has ribonuclease activity as well.Bacteria: Active against bacteria such as M. vaccae and yeast even at 4 oC. Recombinant RNase 7 exhibited antimicrobial activity against uropathogens (E. coli, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumonia, P. mirabilis, E. faecalis, and S. saprophyticus) at low micromolar concentrations by disrupting the microbial membrane as determined by atomic force microscopy (Spencer JD et al., 2013).Viruses: it directly restricts herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection of human keratinocytes, possibly by promoting the degradation of incoming HSV-1 particles (Zeitvogel  et al., 2024).MOA:bacteria:  membrane permeable. However, it targets the outer membrane protein I (OprI) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Lin et al., 2010).Structure:You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Immune modulation: RNase 7 enables human pDCs to recognize self-DNA and promotes their rapid sensing of bacterial DNA. RNase 7 was a markedly stronger trigger for IFN-? expression in human pDCs than the other antimicrobial peptides (Kopfnagel et al., 2018).Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: induced by L-arabinose (3-4 h), affinity column purification.Updated Jan2013; 2/2014; Jan2018; 10/2018; 6/2020; 7/2021; 2/2022; 3/2023; Jan2024; 5/2024 ; 10/2024 GW.",
