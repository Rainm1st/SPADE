    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (88.89%) toProtegrin 5C=G=R: 24%, V: 12%.Activity: active against E. coli ATCC 25922 or ML35p or BW 25113 (MIC 0.5 uM), P. aeruginosa PAO1 or ATCC 27853 or ATCC 9027 (MIC 2-8 uM), A. baumannii (MIC 0.5 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 (MIC 4 uM), S. aureus 209P or ATCC 29213 or MRSA (MIC 2-4 uM), and M. luteus B-1314 (MIC 0.5 uM). Synthetic analog activity: Gram+ S. salivarius 12 strains (MIC 0.2-5.0 ug/ml), S. sanguis 14 strains (MIC 4-64 ug/ml), S. mitis 15 strains (MIC 2-43 ug/ml), S. mutans 3 strains (MIC 0.7-1.3 ug/ml), Streptococcus spp., group D 6 strains (MIC 0.25-4 ug/ml), Streptococcus spp. 16 strains (MIC 1.3-16 ug/ml), Corynebacterium spp. (MIC 0.13-0.25 ug/ml), Staphylococcus spp. 35 strains (MIC 0.13-4 ug/ml), Gram- Moraxella spp. 12 strains (MIC 0.2-0.8 ug/ml), Neisseria sp. (MIC 8 ug/ml), Haemophilus spp. 15 strains (MIC 1-8 ug/ml), A. calcoaceticus 4 strains (MIC 0.06-2 ug/ml), K. pneumoniae 4 strains (MIC 1-5 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa 18 strains (MIC 1-8 ug/ml), E. coli 5 strains (MIC 0.25-1 ug/ml), and S.  marcescens 16 strains (MIC 16->256 ug/ml).Resistance development:no:bacteria:S. aureus: the MIC of IB-367 (and vancomycin polymyxin B) changed little against MRSA or Resistance development:no:bacteria:P. aeruginosa after 32 multiple passages but norfloxaxin increased 32 fold (Mosca et al., 2000).In vitro toxicity: 99.6% hemolysis at 64 uM, similar to WT PG-1.Impact on microbiota:yes:  it showed killing of the oral microflora.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: recombinant peptide was expressed by fusing with thioredoxin to increase solubility, to promote correct disulfide bond formation, and to mask the toxicity of the peptide to the expression host. Yields for AP4991-5004 range from 4.0 to 7.2 mg per liter.Clinical trials: synthetic PG-1 derivative with C-terminal amidation was subjected to clinical trials for the prevention of oral mucositis, a severe consequence of some chemotherapy and radiation therapy regimens.Updated 4/2025",
