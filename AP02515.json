  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: The peptide was captured from alligator plasma by a custom-built functionalized hydrogel microparticles followed byde novosequencing by mass spectrometer.Sequence analysis: This is a unique sequence since it shows only 39.3% SIMILARITY TOLatarcin 3bA fragment of blood apolipoprotein C1.Activity: ApoC1(64-88) is active against E. coli (EC50 0.192 uM), P. aeruginosa (EC50 1.41 uM), B. cereus (EC50 0.245 uM), and S. aureus (EC50 9.66 uM). Note that the peptide was not active in Mueller Hinton Broth but could kill bacteria (e.g.. E. coli, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii in 10 mM phosphate buffer (Barksdale et al., 2016).SAR: A further truncated fragment, apoC1(67-88), was also found to be slightly more active against these bacteria.Structure: Peptide (100 ug/ml) is helical in 50% TFE or 60 mM SDS (more helical than A1P, AP2517).Updated Jan2017; 3/2023; 10/2023 based on Monique's email.",
