    "Literature": "Chemical modification: N-terminus is pyroglutamate.Activity: In low salt medium A, active against A. brassicola (IC50 2 ug/ml), B. cinerea (IC50 2 ug/ml), F. culmorum (IC50 2 ug/ml), F. oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici (IC50 2 ug/ml), P. oryzae (IC50 0.4 ug/ml), and V. dahliae (IC50 1.5 ug/ml).Antimicrobial robustness: Activity of Rs-AFP1 to Rs-AFP3 reduced in the presence of metal ions.MOA:fungi: This peptide is unable to permeabilize liposomes (vesicles).  The activity is related to the level of sphingolipid glucosylceramides (GlcCer) in the fungal membranes (Ravares PM 2008 Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 52: 4522-4525) since alteration of the structure of GlcCer or deletion of GlcCer led to poor activity. The Y38G mutant is not active against fungi, but retains the ability to interact with GlcCer, indicating binding to fungal membranes is necessary but not sufficient to kill fungi (De Samblanx GW et al 1997 J Biol Chem 272: 1171-1179). Recently, Aerts et al (2007 J Mol Microbiol Biotechnol 13: 243-7) showed that interaction of RsAFP2 with fungal GlcCer triggers a signal transduction pathway, leading to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and fungal death. These data support the two-step model for the mode of action (MOA) of RsAFP2.Transgenic plants: expression of this peptide in tobacco/tomato  improves resistance to pathogens (Montesinos E 2007 FEMS Microbiol Lett 270, 1-11). Because it is not toxic to mammalian cells, this plant defensin is an interesting candidate as a novel antifungal agent.Updated 2/2010; Jan2011; formatted 4/2023; 5/2024.",
