    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE shows 37% similarity towasp OdVP3.Activity: It inhibited the in vitro growth of X. axonopodis pv. glycines, the causative agent of the bacterial pustule disease, at 10 uM. Also active ex vivo and in vivo after vector transformation. It remains to be confirmed whether this AMP (exact region?) is expressed to protect soybeans from infection.",
