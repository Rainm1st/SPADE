    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: ~82% similar toAP2334:scorpion Hp1036.Activity: Active against only tested Gram-positive bacteria, including S. aureus AB94004 (also others strains ATCC25923, ATCC6538,  AB208193), S. epidermidis AB208187 (also AB208188), M. luteus AB93113, B. subtilis AB91021, S. aureus MRSA P1381, S. aureus MRSA P1374, E. faecium, and S. agalactiae (MIC 4-16 uM).Animal model:mouse: peritonitis model, the injected peptide did protect the mice in vivo compared to the untreated group.Antimicrobial robustness: Serum, but not salt, might have reduced peptide activity in vivo (Salt-insensitive but serum-sensitive).Structure:  Helical in TFE.SAR:  Changes residues 1 and 8 to lysines (K1K8) led to increased activity and reduced hemolysis.Resistance development:no:bacteria:S. aureus AB94004: after 15 passages, but kanamycin and ampicillin did (Li et al., 2016).Updated 5/2016; 4/2024.",
