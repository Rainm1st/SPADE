    "Literature": "Initialy reported in 2011 without amino acid sequence (Fagundes PC et al., 2011), APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide shows 90.9% similarity toBsaA2. This peptide is plasmid-encoded. it is predicted to have 4 thioether bonds: S3-C7, T8-C11, S16-C21, and S19-C22. The last bridge also involves decarboxylic and dehydration between Calpha and Cbeta carbons (see the ref). In addition, T2, S5 and T14 are dehydrated into Dhb, Dha, and Dhb, respectivley (refer to the APD abbreviations).Activity: Staphylococcal and streptococcal strains involved in bovine mastitis, food-associated pathogens, such as L. monocytogenes and S. aureus, and food-spoilage bacteria, such as B. coagulans and G. stearothermophilus, are among the microorganisms inhibited by the producing strain of hyicin 3682.
