  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (52.94%) toAn-cecBK=A: 18%, R=L: 12%. GRAVY: -0.309; Mol Wt: 3854.68; mol formula: C181H300N53O39; mol ex coeff: 7040.Activity: inhibited P. falciparum 3D7 (IC50 68.63 uM). In addiiton, it inhibited bacterial growth S.aureus (MIC >200 uM), B. subtilis (MIC 18.94 uM), and E. coli (MIC 12.7 uM).Animal model:mouse: showed a dose-dependent inhibition by 17.03%, 39.35%, and 54.19% when IP treated at 10, 20, and 50 mg/kg (4 hpi), respectively, in P. berghei-infected mice (IP).SAR: An-cecB-2 (seq: RAAKKALPVIAGYKAL) and An-cecB-3 (seq: GKRLEKLGRNVFRAAKK) showed small inhibitory effects at 200 uM, indicating the importance of the N-terminal sequence for peptide activity.",
