    "Literature": "Host expression: toxic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from pollutants or viral infection or can suppression the expression of TAP (Bourque et al., 2018).Discovery: First beta-defensins discovered.Chemical modification:  Three disulfide bridges: 5,34; 12,27; 17,35;Activity: Active against E. coli D31 (MIC 12-25 ug/ml), K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883 (MIC 12-25 ug/ml), S. aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC 25-50 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 25-50 ug/ml), C. albicans ATCC 14053 (MIC 6-12 ug/ml).AMP inactivation: animal model:Cattle: direct TAP treatment of pneumonia in calves infected with Mannheimia haemolytica at 0.3, 2, and 6 h postinfection did not protect the development of diseases, probably due to direct inactivation by salts (NaCl-sensitive:M. haemolytica) and serum (serum-sensitive:M. haemolytica) (Vulikh et al., 2019).Therapeutic strategy: a mammary gland tissue-specific expression vector was constructed to express TAP for antibacterial effects in both in vitro and in vivo experiments when introducing this vector to bovine-associated Staphylococcus aureus-treated pBMECs and mice (Zhang et al., 2021).Updated 7/2021; 12/2024",
