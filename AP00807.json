    "Literature": "Spot test: It inhibits the growth of Gram- 4 S. enteritidis strains (MIC 0.2-0.4 ug/ml), S. choleraesuis (MIC 0.4 ug/ml), S. typhimurium (MIC 0.2-0.4 ug/ml), S. enterica serovar Gallinarum (MIC 0.4 ug/ml), six E. coli strains O157:H7 (MIC 0.1-1.6 ug/ml), three Y. enterocolitica strains (MIC 0.1 ug/ml), Y. pseudotuberculosis (MIC 3.2 ug/ml), C. freundii (MIC 1.6 ug/ml), K. pneumoniae (MIC 3.2 ug/ml), S. dysenteriae (MIC 0.1 ug/ml), C. jejuni L4 (MIC 0.1 ug/ml), Gram+ S. aureus, S. epidermidis (MIC 1.6 ug/ml), L. monocytogenes 9-72 (MIC 0.1 ug/ml), and 20 other Campylobacter species isolates (MIC 0.05-1.6 ug/ml in Table 1 in ref).Stability: activity against C. jejuni is lost in the presence of enzymes that cut peptide bonds. The activity is retained in the pH range 5-8.7.In vivo activity: animal model:chicken: incorporation of 125 mg peptide in the feed eliminated the C. jejuni burden in one experiment or natural colonization of Campylobacter species in another experiment using animal model:broiler (domestic chicken) (detection limit log 2 CFU).
