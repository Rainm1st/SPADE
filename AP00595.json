  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: This sequence (called VCP-VT1) has also been found in insects (Yang et al., 2013).  Found in multiple species.  Found both in vertebrates and invertebrates.Activity: Active against S. aureus ATCC 25923 or ATCC 12493 MRSA and 2 clincal strains (MIC 1.2-8 uM). The insect-derived sequence is active against Gram-positive E. faecalis ATCC29212 (MIC 5 uM), Gram-negative E. coli ATCC25922 (MIC 2.5 uM), E. cloacae ATCC13047 (MIC 2.5 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC700603 (MIC 10 uM), B. pyocyaneus CMCCB1010 (MIC 10 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC27853 (MIC 40 uM), B. dysenteriae (MIC 20 uM), E. coli IS 37# (MIC 20 uM), E. coli IS 117# or 218# (MIC 20 uM), P. aeruginosa IS 350# (MIC 5 uM), K. pneumoniae IS 59# (MIC 40 uM), fungi C. albicans ATCC2002 or  ATCC90028 (MIC 10 uM),  and C. parapsilosis ATCC22019 (MIC 2.5 uM).  Also active against Gram+ E. faecalis NCTC 12697 (MIC 16 uM), Gram- E.coli ATCC 8739 (MIC >256 uM), K.pneumoniae ATCC 43816 (MIC >512 uM), P.aeruginosa ATCC 9027 (MIC >512 uM), and yeast C.albicans ATCC 10231 (MIC 32 uM).  Also inhibited biofilms:bacteria:S. aureus (MBIC 8 uM; MBEC 64 uM); biofilms:bacteria:E. faecalis (MBIC 16 uM).MOA:bacteria:S. aureus: it permeabilized bacterial membranes (2xMIC, 50%).Structure:  random coil in 10 mM NH4Ac and helical in 50% TFE/NH4Ac.In vitro toxicity: horse RBC: HC50 44.43 uM, drastically hemolytic above 16 uM.Animal model:Galleria mellonella: survival study: it protected the wax moth worms from death in a dose-dependent manner.Resistance development:no:bacteria:S. aureus: no resistance development after 16 cycles of passages. MIC changed 4 fold (Zhang et al., 2022).Updated 2/2019; 7/2021; 7/2024",
