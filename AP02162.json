    "Literature": "Activity: Active against S. xylosus  and S. aureus. Also: Gram- E. coli CIP 7624 (MIC 24.4 uM), C. sakazakii ATCC 29544 (MIC 5.8), P. aeruginosa CIP 82118, P. aeruginosa CIP 82118 (MIC 8.7-12.2), S. enterica ATCC 29934 (MIC 5.4), Gram+ E. hirae CIP 5855 (MIC 12.2), S. aureus CIP 53156 (MIC 3.0), MRSA  ATCC 43300 (MIC 8.7), S. xylosus ATCC 35033 (MIC 0.45), B. substilis CIP 5262 (MIC 24.4), fungi A. niger CIP 143183 (MIC 0.75), C. albicans CIP 4872, C. albicans [R], CAAL 117 (MIC 17.3), G. candidum ATCC 204307 (MIC (97.5), S. cerevisiae sp (MIC 6.1), and parasite L. infantum (MIC 1.5). In addition,  bicarinalin can significantly decrease the density of H. pylori on gastric cells (Guzman J et al., 2017).Structure: It is helical in TFE or in SDS micelles based on CD. NMR studies revealed a helical struture in the region of 6-16 in TFE, explaining the membrane permeation action of the peptide.Activity robustness: Bicarinalin was still active against S. aureus for about 15 h after incubation in human serum.Toxicity: Its cytotoxicity against human lymphocytes is about 10 fold the average MIC value. An N-terminal 4-residue truncated fragment corresponding to residues 5-20 was found to have an MIC of 9 uM against S. aureus. Updated 4/2016; Jan2018.",
