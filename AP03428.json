    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (93.33%) toTemporin-1CEaI:20%; L=F=N=13%; Mol formula: C83H137N17O21; Mol Wt: 1735.096; Mol Ex Coeff: 0; GRAVY:  0.906.Activity: active against S. aureus ATCC CRM 6538 (MIC 8 uM, pH 7), MRSA NCTC 12493 (MIC 16 uM), E. faecalis (MIC 32 uM), K.pneumoniae (MIC 256 uM), P.aeruginosa (MIC 128 uM), and E.coli (MIC 128 uM).Antimicrobial robustness: Salt-sensitive, pH-sensitive, serum-sensitive: Anti-staph activity is susceptible to pH (MIC 128 uM at pH 6 or pH 8), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Mg2+, 4 uM FeCl3, and 10% FBS (all MIC 128 uM)! It could inhibit biofilm formation (MBIC 64 uM) of S. aureus but could not disrupt preformed mature biofilms (MBEC> 256 uM).Structure:  random coils in water but helix in 50% TFE, 1% SDS, S. aureus (DOPC:DOPG = 1:1) and E.coli (DOPE:DOPG = 3:1) liposome constitutions (CD);MOA:  increase in fluorescence from SYTOX GREEN nucleic dye implies membrane permeabilization by the peptide.",
