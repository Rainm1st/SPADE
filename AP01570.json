  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Shown is the AA sequence of Trn-alpha (link to PDB). The AA sequence of Trn-beta is GWVACVGACGTVCLASGGVGTEFAAASYFL (visit PDB using 2LA0). In each chain, Cys residues at positions 5, 9, and 13 form three unusual sulfur to alpha-carbon bonds. Heternuclear NMR played an important role to establish such chemical bonds, which stabilizes two parallel helical structures (Sit CS et al. 2011 JACS 133:7680-3).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. It is active against clinical C. difficile isolates (MIC in the range of nM), especailly the hypervirulent PCR ribotype 027. Updated 12/23/2011; 2/2014; 9/2020 GW.",
