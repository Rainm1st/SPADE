    "Literature": "Host expression: It is constitutively expressed in all of the tested tissues, including the hemocytes, hepatopancreas, gill, gonad, posterior adductor muscle and mantle. It can also be induced in the presence of pathogens.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 66.7% similarity toMytimacin-AF. PI 8.38; GRAVY=-0.728; Mol Mass. 8883.162, Mol. Ext coeff: 45890, mol formula: C392H575N105O108S11.Activity: Active against Gram+ B. subtilis ATCC6633 (MIC 0.315 uM), S-aureus (MIC >1.24 uM), M. luteus ATCC4698 (MIC 1.24 uM), Gram- V-anguillarum KV9001, E-cloacae ATCC700323, P-putida ATCC49128, P-mirabilis ATCC25933 (MIC >1.24 uM), E. aerogenes ATCC13048 (MIC 1.24 uM), and V. parahaemolyticus ATCC17802 (MIC 0.62 uM). V. parahaemolyticus is a primary pathogen for the bivalve in the marine environment.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: IPTG induced expression, purification via Ni2+ chelating sepharose column, refolded in gradient urea-TBS glycerol buffer.
