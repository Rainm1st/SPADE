    "Literature": "Discovered in 2008 (see the ref), this peptide is rich in lysines (38%). NA-CATH is predominantly alpha-helical in SDS and TFE (Dean S et al., 2011a).Activity: Active against Gram- and Gram+ bacteria (A. actinomycetemcomitans, E. coli, F. novicida, P. aeruginosa, B. thailandensis, and S. aureus) (Amer L et al., 2010;de Latour F et al., 2010;Dean S et al., 2011a;Dean S et al., 2011b) at concentrations < 1 ÂµM). It also inhibit B. anthracis (MIC 16 ug/ml) (Blower et al., 2018). It also has anti-biofilm activity against S. aureus (Dean S et al., 2011a).Toxicity: NA-CATH has low toxicity against host cells (de Latour F et al., 2010). These studies also showed that small 11-aa peptide variants based on a repeated pattern within NA-CATH   (KR(F/A)KKFFKK(L/P)K) have similar antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity to the parent peptide, but not when proline is present (de Latour F et al., 2010;van Hoek M, 2014). NMR studies revealed a well-defined helical region between residues 3-23 with the rest 11 residues disordered in the micelle-bound stateDu H et al., 2015.
