    "Literature": "Discovery: isolated from human amniotic fluid (2012 ref) as well as human broncho-alveolar-lavage (BAL) fluid (2020 ref).Sequence analysis: APD calcualted: molecular formula: C528H805N135O158S3; mol. wt: 11701.176;  molar extinction coefficient: 20165; GRAVY= -0.74; Wimley-White whole-residue hydrophobicity of the peptide,  25.07 kcal/mol.Activity: Active against S. aureus ATCC25923, L. monocytogenes ATCC19115, S. epidermidis KCTC1917, E. coli ATCC25922, P. vulgaris KCTC2433 (MIC 0.3-2.4 uM).Antimicrobial conditions: it is more active against L. monocytogenes at acidic conditions pH 5.5 and below, characteristic of infection and inflammation. No activity at pH 6 or above (Holch et al., 2020).Molecular form: It is in its non-aggregated form at pH 7 and shows fibril formation at pH 4.5 (Amyloid AMPs?).Structure:You can rotate, zoom, and view the crystal structure 1B1Iherein the PDB.Updated  2/2014; 3/2023.",
