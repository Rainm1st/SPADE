    "Literature": "Host expression: Constitutively expressed in skin, thymus, gills, adipose tissues, brain, etc, CK11 was significantly induced in response to Y. ruckeri in the skin but not in the gills, implying a defense role in the skin.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 34.4% similarity tohuman Thrombocidin-1.  Phylogenetically related to human  CCL27 and CCL28.Activity: Active against the fish Gram+ pathogen L. garvieae CF00021 (IC50 0.0272 uM), and also  Gram- fish pathogens A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida (IC50 0.0033 uM) and Y. ruckeri LMG3279 (IC50 0.1407 uM).
