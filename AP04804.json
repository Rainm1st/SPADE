    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (60%) toLK2F: 40%; K: 40%.Activity: active against S. aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC 32 uM), B. subtilis ATCC 23857 (MIC 16 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 (MIC 16 uM), E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 32 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 16 uM), A. baumannii ATCC 19606 (MIC 64 uM).In vitro toxicity: hRBC: HC10 >256 uM. HC50 >256 uM. not hemo.lytic. LC50 >128 uM not toxic to human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293T).Structure:  random coil in water and helical in 50% TFE. Helicity is length-dependent and longer peptides are more helical in the series.",
