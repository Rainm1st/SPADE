    "Literature": "Discovery: Found in multiple species. Also isolated from atraditionally fermented Chinese meat product (Zhang et al., 2013).Activity: Active against L. sakei subsp. sakei CIP 103139 (MIC 8 nM), E. faecium HKLHS (MIC 256 nM), L. lactis CIP 102422 (MIC 256 nM),  L. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides CIP 102305 (MIC 16 nM), L. innocua CIP 80.11 (MIC 256 nM), and L. monocytogenes CIP 82.110 (MIC 512 nM) (Makhloufi KM et al., 2013). The MIC against L. monocytogenes (MIC 6.8 uM) for a synthetic form of pediocin PA-1, similar to the natural form. Also active against E. coli.Plantaricin BM-1 decreases viability of SW480 human colorectal cancer cells by inducing caspase-dependent apoptosis (Wang et al., 2023).SAR:  A linear analog without the two disulfide bonds (Cys9–Cys14 and Cys24–Cys44) was as potent.Structure: The Cys9–Cys14 bond is conserved among the class IIa bacteriocins, as is the N-terminal YGNGV sequence, both features being signatures of this family. The NMR structure of a peptide analog M31L has been solved.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structurehere(Bédard F, et al. 2018).Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: multiple expression systems have been reported;Recombinant production:bacteria:Lactococcus lactis: e.g.martin et al., 2007;Recombinant production:yeast:Saccharomyces cerevisiae: e.g.,Nguyen et al., 2020.Packaging film coating: coating this peptide to food packing film can reduce L. monocytogenes CFU/g (Yang et al., 2019).AMPs in use:food preservation: this bacteriocin is also produced as a food preservative in use; a crude fermented form is commercially available from Quest International as ALTA2341:  fermented ALTA 2341®; freeze-dried culture CHOOZIT™ FLAV 43 (Makholufi et al., 2013).Updated 3/2014; 6/2015; 7/2016; 8/2018; 2/2023; 4/2024; 10/2024 GW",
