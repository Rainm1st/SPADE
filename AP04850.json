    "Literature": "AMP significance: Jin et al. (this ref) shows that increased expression of DEFB119 can not only distort the seminal microbiome composition of male sperm via regulating bacterial population but also decrease sperm motility, providing insight into male infertility (Li et al., 2022).Host expression: highly expressed in the testis and epididymis of the human reproductive system (Radhakrishnan et al., 2005).Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (64.06%) torat DEFB24C=S: 11%. GRAVY: -0.92, mol Wt: 7492.687; mol formula: C318H510N94O94S9; mol ex coeff: 17497.5.Activity: active against  P. stercorea (~20% decrease at 12 ug/ml), S. mitis (~reduced ~15% at 12 ug/ml), S. Anginosus (reduced >20% at 12 ug/ml), and S. intermedius (reduced 10% at 12 ug/ml) but not P-aeruginosa or P-copri at 12 ug/ml. Notably, the defensin promoted growth at 3 ug/ml but inhibited growth at an elevated concentration.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: the recombinant form of this peptide rDEFB119 can be purchased from a commercial source (see the paper).UniProt: Additional info, including AlphaFold predicted structureQ8N690.",
