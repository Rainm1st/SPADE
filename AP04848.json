    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (63.64%) toHHC-48W: 55%; K: 45%. GRAVY: -2.26, mol Wt: 1776.143; mol formula: C96H128N22O12; mol ex coeff: 33300.Activity: active against Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 25923A (MIC 25 uM), S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC 3.12 uM), B. megaterium Bm 11 (MIC 0.75 uM), Gram- bacteria A. baumannii ATCC 19606 (MIC 50 uM), , P. aeruginosa (MIC 3.12 uM), E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 6.25 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 or 19595 or 4 clinical strains (MIC 1.56-6.12 uM), and yeast C. albicans ATCC 24433 (MIC 6.25 uM). Bactericidal effect. It inhibited biofilm formation:P. aeruginosa as gauged by biomass (CV) and metabolic activity.MOA:bacteria:S. epidermidis: MOA:bacteria:P. aeruginosa:  MOA:fungi:C. albicans: the peptide showed membrane permeabilizaiton.Resistance development:no:bacteria:P. aeruginosa 19595:  the clinical isolate P. aeruginosa 19595 did not develop clear resistance to the peptide (MIC change 2 fold) or colistin (MIC change up to 4 fold) after 15 passages.In vitro toxicity: showed minimal toxicity to HaCaT cells (20% viability decrease at 25 uM and 25% decrease at 50 uM).",
