  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide shows 82.1% similarity toBuforin I. It is a C-terminally truncated version of AP2811 with activity similar to AP2811, implying that the C-terminal sequence of AP2811 is less important.Activity: Active against E. coli ML35p (MIC 0.3 uM), L. monocytogenes EGD (MIC 1.0 uM), MRSA ATCC 33591 (MIC 0.6 uM), and C. albicans 820 (MIC 0.9 uM).Toxicity: human RBC: no hemolysis till 40 uM.
