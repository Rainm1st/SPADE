  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Active against fungi A. longipes (IC50 3 ug/ml), B. cinerea (IC50 6 ug/m), C. sphaerospermum (IC50 1 ug/m), F. culmorum (IC50 1 ug/m), P. digitatum (IC50 3 ug/m), T. viride (IC50 6 ug/m), and V. alboatrum (IC50 6 ug/m). IC50: 50% inhibition concentration. Compared to other Ib-AMP peptides, IB-AMP4 is less salt-sensitive: 50% inhibition concentration increased dramatically to the range of 6 to 200 ug/ml (4-33 fold higher) when the medium was supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2 and 50 mM KCl.  Also active against N. crassa, B. cinerea, F. culmorum (IC50 1-3 uM), S. cerevisiae (IC50 13  uM), and P. pastoris (IC50  5 uM). The N-terminal glutamine is believed to be cyclized (i.e., pyroglutamate, XXQ). It contains two disulfide bonds (6-16 and 7-20). A recombinant form is active against clinical multiresistant isolates including S. aureus MRSA, and extended spectrum ÃŸ-lactamases-producing E. coli (Fan X et al., 2013).SAR:  Activity and sequence relationship was investigated. R-scan (Mcc02 to Mcc15) or W-scan (Mcc16-Mcc24; MCD17-MCD25) showed little effect on antifungal activity against F. culmorum (Peptides. 2005 Jul;26(7):1113-9).MOA:  SEM: membrane damage.Toxicity:  not hemo.lytic HC50 >200 uM; not toxic to human skin fibroblasts at 100 uM.Animal model:mouse:  peptide treatment protected mice from skin and systemic infection. No MRSA detected in blood (Samira Sadelaji et al., 2022). Updated 5/30/2013; 7/2021; 6/2022",
