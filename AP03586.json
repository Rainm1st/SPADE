    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (33.33%) toBovine beta-casein(114-119)E:60%. Mol. Wt: 575.575; GRAVY: -0.9; Mol Formula:  C23H37N5O12; mol ex coeff: 0.Discovery: Screened from 2000 plant-derived lactic acid bacteria via agar well diffusion.Purification: Ethyl acetate extraction followed by chromatographic purification (gel filtration and HPLC).Activity: inhibition zone assay: Active against Gram+ S. aureus ATCC6538 (29.14 mm), L. monocytogenes ATCC19115 (28.88 mmm), B. subtilis (21.02 mm), B. cereus CMCC(B)63301 (28.79 mm), M. luteus CMCC(B)28001 (21. 8 mm), Gram- P. aeruginosa ATCC15442 (26.91 mm), E. coli CMCC9181 (27.32 mm), Salmonella (21.7 mm), Shigella CMCC(B)51105 (22.29 mm), and P. mirabilis CMCC(B)49027 (23.47 mm).Antimicrobial robustness: thermal stability: treating 10 min at 100oC, 82.2% activity retained; at 121oC, 73.4% activity retained. pH: more active at pH 2 against S. aureus but less active at basic pH 11.",
