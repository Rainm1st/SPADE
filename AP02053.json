    "Literature": "Identification:Identified through a bioinformatic mining of genomes. It is the largest lasso discovered till 2012.Chemical modification:  An amide bond formed between N-terminal G1 and D9, excluding the possible G1-E7 connection.Activity: spot-on-lawn assay. 2.2 mM solution was only showed activity against C. crescentus CB15 but not E.coli BL21, V.harveyi, V.fischeri, B.thailandensis (producer of capistruin), S.newport (hypersensitive to MccJ25). Likely species-specific.Structure: Solution structure was determined.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. Updated 2/2014; 7/2021.",
