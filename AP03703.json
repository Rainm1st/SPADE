Also showed cytotoxicity to cancer cells lung adenocarcinoma A549 (LC50 30.7 uM), breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells (LC50 64.2 uM), and colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells (LC50 84.9 uM).Toxicity: non-neoplastic human umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVEC (LC50 54 uM). This peptide is non-selective.Structure: random coil in water and became helical in the presence of 50% TFE, DPC or SDS micelles.",
