  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: identified from the screening of a collection of 20,000 microbial extracts.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (95.24%) toSiamycin IIC=G: 19%; I=F=A=D: 10%. GRAVY:  1.17; mol Wt: 2200.573; mol formula: C98H139N22O28S4; mol ex coeff: 7290.Chemical modification:  cyclized from the side chain of Asp9 to the N-terminus of Cysl. Two disulfide bonds: C1-C13 and C7-C19, lleading to a tricyclic structure. Last W is a D-amino acid (Sánchez-Hidalgo et al., 2020).Activity: inhibits the growth of A. fumigatus and C. albicans in the presence of caspofungin (CAS).Synergy:drug: Potentiated the CAS antifungal effect against A. fumigatus with a decrease in the CAS MEC from 0.12 to 0.015 ug/ml and against C. albicans with a drop in the CAS MIC from 0.25 to 0.03 ug/ml.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: the gene cluster has been cloned into the bacterium and succeeded in peptide expression.
