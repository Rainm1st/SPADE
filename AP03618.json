    "Literature": "AMPs and human disease: Colorectal cancer (CRC) specific conditions promote Streptococcus gallolyticus gut colonization. It secretes gallocin A to kill commensal microbiota bacteria. Gallocin A porduction is increased in the presence of secondary bile acids, a known risk factor of CRC. Bile acid enhances peptide activity. By using mice genetically prone to colorectal cancer, SGG colonization is 1,000-fold higher in tumor-bearing mice than in normal mice.Sequence analysis: It is atypical two-chain bacteriocin with intramolecular disulfide bonds required for activity) (Proutière et al., 2023). APD analysis reveals this GllA1 sequence is most similar (39.13%) toHyicin 4244G:26%; A: 19%; I: 12%. GRAVY:1.119; M Wt: 3752.464; Mol formula:  C161H273N43O50S4; molar extinction coeff: 1615. Chain B sequence (GllA2): YSKTDCLNAMITGIAGGIVAGGTGAGLVTLGVAGLPGAFVGAHIGAIGGGATCVGGMLFN.Activity: agar spot test: It kills E. faecalis from murine microbiota.MOA: membrane permeabilization was observed in the presence of both peptide chains. It is proposed that the disulfide bond is essential to stabilize the modeled helical hairpin structure in both chains (refer to Proutière et al., 2023).",
