PNAS 96:8913-8). It also inhibited HIV-1 infection in cultured human T-lymphoblast (CEM-SS) cells (EC50 40-260 nM) and cytotoxicity (TC50 500 nM), therapeutic index (2-12)(Ireland et al., 2008).Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-sensitive:E. coli (100 mM); NaCl-sensitive:P. vulgaris (100 mM); NaCl-sensitive:K. oxytoca (100 mM); NaCl-sensitive:C. kefyr (100 mM).Structure:  It is cyclic and contains three disulfide bonds (Tam JP et al.
