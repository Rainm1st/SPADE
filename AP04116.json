    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (47.83%) tosynthetic LL-14K:35%; L: 17%. GRAVY: -0.883; mol Wt: 2845.6; mol formula: C136H231N38O26S1; mol ex coeff: 5550Chemical modification:  C-terminal amidation.Activity:  active against fungi C. neoformans H99 (1.41 uM), C. albicans ATCC 10231 (44.98 uM), C. tropicalis ATCC 20962 (MIC 1.41 uM) (see ref), Gram- bacteria A. baumannii ATCC 19606 and 5 Carbapenem-resistant strains (MIC 8 ug/ml), E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 8 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa CMCC 10104 (MIC 16 ug/ml), K. pneumoniae ATCC 70060 (MIC 16 ug/ml), and Gram+ S. aureusATCC 25923 (MIC 64 ug/ml) (Yang et al., 2024). MBC values were either identical or higher, indicating direct killing.Biofilms:fungi:C. neoformans and Biofilms:bacteria:A. baumannii ATCC 19606: The peptide was also able to inhibit biofilm formation and showed biofilm disruption in terms of biomass and matabolic activity in a dose-dependent manner from 8 to 64 ug/ml (at 64 ug/ml ~50% disruption).Structure: random coils in water or 50% TFE, but displayed helical feature in membrane-mimetic SDS micelles (30 mM).Toxicity: low hemosis (HC50 ~128 ug/ml). Low level effects on viability of HegG2 and LO2 cells at 64 ug/ml.Resistance development:no:fungi:C. neoformans H99: C. neoformans H99 did not develop resitance to the peptide after 30 passages.Antimicrobial robustness: pH-insensitive (pH 4-10); NaCl-insensitive:C. neoformans (150 mM), KCl-insensitive:C. neoformans (4.5 mM), CaCl2-sensitive:C. neoformans (2 mM), MIC insensitive to 10% serum (FBS).Peptide stability: lost activity in the presence of trypsin.MOA:fungi:C. neoformans: the peptide disrupted the membranes of C. neoformans. Also reduced the thickness of the capsule.MOA:bacteria:A. baumannii: permeabilized bacterial membranes (PI).Animal model:wax moth: DvAMP protected the animals from death of Galleria mellonella larvae at day 5 in a dose-dependent manner from 8 to 32 mg/kg.",
