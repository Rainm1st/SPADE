    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide shows 42.9% similarity toLf-CATH2.  Molecular formula:  C148H271N41O40S2; M Wt 3368.142; GRAVY= 0.34; Wimley-White whole-residue hydrophobicity of the peptide: 7.85  kcal/mol.Activity: Active against Gram- bacteria E.  coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 0.69 uM), S. paratyphi A ATCC 9150 (MIC 1.39 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 1.39 uM), A. junii ATCC 17908 (MIC 2.78 uM), Gram+ bacteria S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC 5.57 uM), S. haemolyticus ATCC 29970 (MIC 5.57 uM), E. faecalis ATCC 29212 (MIC 5.57 uM), fungi C. glabrata ATCC 66032 (MIC 1.39 uM), and C. albicans ATCC 14053 (MIC 5.57 uM).MOA: there is clear damage to cell envelope after treatment.Anti-inflammatory: In addition, it binds to LPS and inhibits LPS-induced chemokine release (TNFalpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6).Structure: Helix formation in the presence of SDS (~40% helix, little change from 5 to 40 mM) or LPS (~50% helix, dose-dependent from 50 to 400 ng/ml).
