  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "A C15 fatty acid chain is attahced to the N-terminus of the peptide (XXL). The carboxyl-terminal Ile is connected to Thr by ester linkage (XXJ). In addition, the first and fourth K's are ornithine (represented with K). Paenibacterin is readily soluble in water and fairly stable to exposure to heat and a wide range of pH values.Active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria tested, including L. monocytogenes, S. aureus (MRSA), E. coli O157:H7, and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium. MOA: The peptide binds to LPS (BBL) and can disrupt bacterial membranes (Huang and Yousef, 2014).",
