    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (95.24%) toSPINK9-v1.GRAVY: -0.85; Mol Wt: 7320.535; Mol formula: C323H497N89O89S8.Activity:  Active against E. coli, but not P.aeruginosa NCTC 11440 and ATCC 10145, S.aureus ATCC 6538, S.pyogenes ATCC 12344 or the yeast strain C.albicans ATCC 24433 (data not shown). It is also a pH-dependent protease inhibitor (higher activity at lower pH). It is possible this peptide targets E. coli periplasmic or/and membrane proteases. Bacterial chaperon SKP is a major SPINK9-interacting protein partner.  Reg. 11/2021",
