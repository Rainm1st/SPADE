  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Peptide conjugate:CPP: TAT cell penetraing peptide is coupled with KR-12 at the N-terminus.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (58.33%) toSK-21R: 39%, K: 17%.Activity: active against Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 25923 or MRSA ATCC 43300 (MIC 16 ug/ml), S. epidermidis ATCC 35984 or MRSE ATCC 287 (MIC 8 ug/ml), and Gram- E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 16 ug/ml). MBC values are 2-4 fold higher.SAR: this peptide conjugate is more active than KR-12 (MIC 256-512 ug/ml against Gram+), especially against Gram+ pathogens.MOA:bacteria:E. coli: it permeated (ONPG and PI) and depolarized membranes (DiSC3(5)).Animal model:mouse: skin abscess: more effective than vancomycin in treating intracellular bacterial infection. Reduced CFU and promoted wound healing. In the 100 ng/ml LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, this peptide could suppress the release of NO, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha (Anti-inflammatary).",
