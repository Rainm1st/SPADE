    "Literature": "Activity:Active against G+ bacteria S. aureus ATCC 6535 (MIC 30 ug/ml), S. saprophyticus (MIC 30 ug/ml), and G- bacteria E. coli CCT 1371 (MIC 15 ug/ml), and P. aeruginsa ACCT 27853 (MIC 30 ug/ml). Jelleines are produced constitutively by the workers and secreted into Royal Jelly. Compared to jellein-I, jellein-III only contains one additional residue E at the N-terminus. This acidic residue may explain the lower activity of this peptide than jelleine-I or II. Note that jelleine-IV is not active against any microbes evaluated.
