    "Literature": "Discovery: homologous cecropin screening of the representative transcriptomes from the 1000 Insect Transcriptome Evolution (1KITE) dataset based on known cecropins from the APD and NCBI.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (50%) toCecropin CpI: 10.38; GRAVY: -0.279; Mol Wt: 4542.339; Mol formula: C209H341N58O54; Mol Ex coeff:  7040.Activity: active against Gram- E. coli ATCC25922 (MIC 8 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa CGMCC 1.10712 (MIC 32 ug/ml), but not Gram+ M.luteus ATCC9341 (MIC >128 uM) and S.aureus ATCC6538 (MIC > 128 ug/ml). Activity against E. coli also observed in zone inhibition (20 ug peptide).Toxicity: sheep RBC (4%): 2.19% hemolysis at 50 ug/ml.Structure: helical in SDS or 50% TFE.SAR: delete the last four residues AKQG led to an enhanced activity against P. aeruginosa (MIC 8 ug/ml) (preliminary data).
