    "Literature": "Peptide discovery: the first reported genome predicted cathelicidin.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence shows similarity (41.67%) toBMAP-27-(1-18)R: 23%, F=K: 18%, G: 14%. A longer form (29 residues) of cathelicidin with four additional residues at the C-terminus was subsequnetly reported from the same species (See AP2965). This long form is temporarily assigned as \"natural\" until the peptide is isolated.Activity: Active against Gram- E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 3 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 8 ug/ml), S. typhimurium ATCC 14028 (MIC 2 ug/ml), Gram+ S.aureus ATCC 29213 (MIC >128 ug/ml), B. cereus ATCC 10876 (MIC 32 ug/ml).In vitro toxicity: chicken RBC, 4% hemolysis at 64 ug/ml. concentration-dependent.",
