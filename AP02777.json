  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "The amino acid analysis (including D and L types) of the molecule was initially reported in 1978 (Kato T et al., 1978). A full sequence and activity characterization was achieved recently (see the ref). APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE shows 37.5% similarity toPaenibacterin.Activity: Mainly active against G- bacteria (see beloe) and only weakly active against Gram+ B. subtilis JH642 (MIC 50 uM), S. aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC 100 uM), Gram- food pathogens C. jejuni NCTC 11168 (MIC 100 uM), E. coli DH5alpha (MIC 50 uM), and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (MIC 25 uM). Also active against resistant strains of K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, and E. coli. It is not active (MIC>100 uM) against C.maltaromaticum UAL26, E.faecium ATCC 19434, L.lactis subsp. cremoris HP, L.monocytogenes ATCC 15313, P.polymyxa NRRL B-30509, P.acidilactici PAC 1.0, and P.aeruginosa ATCC 15442.Warning: the sequence is represented as a close mimic. In particular, there are two D-type 2,4-diaminobutyrate (Dab), represented by K's here. In addition, residue V1, S4, W5, and I12 are also D-amino acids.MOA:  this peptide binds to lipid II of Gram-negative bacteria.Structure:  NMR studies in lipid II doped DPC micelles revealed specific interactions (Cochrane SA et al., 2016).You can rotate, zoom, and view the lipid II bound 3D structureherein the PDB.SAR: A synthetic form with an Octanoyl chain retained the the activity against E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 3.1 uM), S. enterica ATCC 13311 (MIC 6.25 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 25 uM), C. jejuni NCTC 11168 (MIC 1.56), K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883 (MIC 3.13), A. baumannii ATCC 19606 (MIC 12.5 uM), E. faecalis ATCC29212 (MIC 100 uM), S. aureus ATCC 29213 (MIC 100 uM), L. monocytogenes ATCC 15313 (MIC 25 uM), and E. faecium ATCC 19434 (MIC 50 uM). Ala scan identified critical amino acids for activity. The antimicrobial activity of the analogues is directly correlated to their ability to adopt a stable secondary structure in a membrane environment (Cochrane SA et al., 2014). H-TriA1, a much less active form,  does not contain an unacylated chain.  Updated 10/2017.",
