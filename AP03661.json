    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (90%) todesign template D4-NH2R: 40%; K=W: 30%.  GRAVY: -3.24; M Wt: 1585.916; Mol formula: C75H119N28O11; molar extinction coeff: 16650.Activity: active against E. coli (MIC 3 uM), S. aureus (MIC 3 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 6 uM)Antimicrobial robustness: MIC changed differently in the presence of 150 mM NaCL: NaCl-insensitive:E. coli; NaCl-insensitive:S. aureus; NaCl-sensitive:P. aeruginosa.Toxicity: it caused 6.5% hemolysis at 100 uM (low hemo.lytic).SAR: The amidated peptide was more active than the non-amidated counterpart.
