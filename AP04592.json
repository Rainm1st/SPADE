  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (92.31%) toAlloferon 1G: 38%, H: 31%.Activity: active against Gram+ S. aureus ATCC25923 or penicillin-resistant (MIC 8-16 ug/ml), S. epidermidis penicillin-resistant (MIC 16 ug/ml), Gram- E. coli ATCC25922 or penicillin-resistant (MIC 4-8 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa ATCC27853 or penicillin-resistant (MIC 8-16 ug/ml), and K. pneumoniae ATCC13883 or penicillin-resistant (MIC 8 ug/ml).Synergy:antibiotics: checkerboard assays: showed synergy (FICI 0.375) with ampicillin against both E. coli and S. aureus. synergy with ceftazidime (FICI 0.375) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and K. pneumoniae.In vitro toxicity: sheep RBC: little or no hemolysis at 320 ug/ml or below (less hemo.lytic), and reached 50% hemolysis in the range 640-1280 ug/ml. Also showed low toxicity to mouse spleen cells.Animal model:mouse: IP treated (5, 10, and 15 mg/kg) 30 min post infection (IP) with E. coli. It protected ICR mice from death in a dose-dependent manner.",
