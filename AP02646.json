    "Literature": "Discovery: It can only be expressed when the bacterium was grown on solid culture medium. Chromatigraphic purification, including HPLC.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide most resembles (84.6% similarity)Streptococcin A-FF22.Chemical modification: Three thioether bonds: residues 8-13; 10-24, and 17-25. In addition, residue 23 is dehydrated.Activity: inhibition zone: Active against nearly all the S. suis strains tested, including antibiotic resistance strains.",
