  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "It showed activity against human pathogens such as E. coli, S. aureus, and P. syringae. It also showed antifungal activity against F. culmorum (MIC 50 ug/ml), a spoilage fungus commonly found on cereals and cereal products (Schmidt et al., 2019). In silico prediction as beta-structure similar to other defensins. As many as 4 S-S bonds are possible. A linear analog, KT43C, is active against F. culmorum, P. expansum and A. niger. It appears to damage membranes and induce reactive oxygen species (Food Microbi 2018). This study suggests that disulfide bonds are not absoultely needed for activity. Updated 3/2018; 5/2019.",
