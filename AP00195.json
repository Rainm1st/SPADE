  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Activity against E. coli 004(MIC 0.12 ug/ml), VREF 032 (MIC 0.25 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027 (MIC 0.5 ug/ml), S. aureus ATCC 33591 or MRSA (MIC 2 ug/ml) and C. albicans ATCC 10231 (MIC 8 ug/ml). It also inhibit B. anthracis (MIC 16 ug/ml) (Blower et al., 2018). Active against HSV-1, HSV-2 (D>L: D-form is more active) (Yasin et al., 2000); porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in vitro (Guo C et al., 2014), and human Rhinovirus 1B (HRV1B) (Sousa et al., 2017).Antimicrobial robustness:  NaCl-insensitive:E. coli (150 mM salt); KCl-insensitive:E. coli (4.5 mM salt), NH4Cl-insensitive:E. coli (6 uM salt), MgCl2-insensitive:E. coli (1 mM salt), CaCl2-insensitive:E. coli (2.5 mM salt); ZnCl2-insensitive:E. coli (8 uM salt), FeCl3-insensitive:E. coli (4 uM salt); NaCl-sensitive:S. aureus (150 mM salt); KCl-insensitive:S. aureus (4.5 mM salt), NH4Cl-insensitive:S. aureus (6 uM salt), MgCl2-insensitive:S. aureus (1 mM salt), CaCl2-insensitive:S. aureus (2.5 mM salt); ZnCl2-insensitive:S. aureus (8 uM salt), and FeCl3-insensitive:S. aureus (4 uM salt).  PG-1 byitself can form extended amyloid fibrils (amyloid AMPs) very similar to those of classic disease-forming amyloids (Jang et al., 2011.Chemical modification:  Two disulfide bridges: 6,15; 8,13.Structure:You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. The first 4 residues are not esential for antibacterial activity but important for antifungal activity. It probably forms a dimer in membranes (dimer in DPC and dimeric structure in lipid bilayer (PDB ID: 1ZY6). Larger oligomers are possible.MOA:bacteria: The mechanism of action involves \"pore\" formation (ref). Simulation based on ssNMR work suggests an octomer in membranes (ref). The sequence of IB-367 is RGGLCYCRGRFCVCVGR and the peptide is active against bacteria and fungi. For other IB-peptides derived from PG-1, please refer to Che J et al (2000) Biopolymers 55:88-98. Chen et al. also found that the D- and L-forms of three derivatives showed similar activity (D=L).In vitro toxicity: 96.1% hemolysis at 64 uM (see ref. AP05000).Synergy:AMPs: This peptide showed synergistic effect with LL-37 against P. aeruginosa and E. coli (Yan H & Hancock REW 2001 Antimicrob Agents Chemother 45: 1558-60).Animal model:mouse:  IB-367 also affects Gram-positive biofilms in vivo of S. aureus and E. faecalis, thereby having the potential of being used as adjuvant agent to linezolid treatment(Ghiselli R et al., 2007).Anti-inflammatory: TNF-alpha production due to LPS (lipopolysaccharide) stimulation was suppressed (Koszalka et al., 2011).
