    "Literature": "AMP significance: RNase 4 protects humans from invasive UPEC infection and suppression of RNase 4 expression may be a risk factor for more severe or recurrent urinary tract infection.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (37.2%) tomouse RNase 6R=L: 10%. GRAVY: -0.372; mol Wt: 16840.576; mol formula: C726H1176N217O209S14; mol ex coeff: 13500. Sequence obtained from Swiss-Prot (Uniprot):P34096.Activity: active against uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC).Structure:  three helical and four beta strands. The crystal structure is in complex with D(UP). It reveals the unique active site for the uridine specificity (Terzyan et al., 1999).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: the protein was expressed in E. coli.Therapeutic strategy: Repurposing HDAC inhibitors to enhance ribonuclease 4 and 7 expression and reduce urinary tract infection (Schwartz et al., 2023).Est.Jan2024;",
