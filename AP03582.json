    "Literature": "Warning: the amino acid sequence has been extensively modified. Structure is Methyldecanoyl-MePro-AHMOD-Ser-Aib-Ile-Iva-bAla-Alaol-Glyol (see below).Chemical modification: P1 is methylated, residue 2 is represented by Q but it is 2-Amino-4-methyl-6-hydroxy-8-oxo decanoic acid (AHMOD), residue 4 is a methylated Ala (Aib), residue 6 is isovaline, residue 7 is beta-alanine, residue 8 is alaninol, and residue 9 is ethanolamine.Activity: Zone inhibition assays: active against fungi: A. niger ATCC 16404 (9 mm), but not other fungi. The MIC values for EmiC were in the 0.5–4 µg/mL range\nMicrodilution assays: The MIC values for EmiC were in the 4-8 ug/mL range: A. niger ATCC 16404 (MIC 32 ug/ml), A. niger 1133 m (MIC 32 ug/ml), A. terreus 3 K (MIC 8 ug/ml), A. terreus 497 (MIC 8 ug/ml), A. fumigatus VKM F-37 (MIC 16 ug/ml), and A. fumigatus 390 m (MIC 16 ug/ml).",
