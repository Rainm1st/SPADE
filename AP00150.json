    "Literature": "Activity: Active against S. aureus ATCC29213 or NCDC-0111 or MRSA (MIC 1.5-3 uM), L. monocytogenes ATCC-19111 (MIC 6 uM), B. cereus NCDC-0240 (MIC 0.8 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC-27853 or NCDC-0105 (MIC 12.5-25 uM), S. enterica serovar typhimurium ATCC-14028 (MIC 12.5 uM), E. coli MTCC-0723 (MIC 0.8 uM), and A. johnsonii NCDC-0072 (MIC 6 uM) (Brahma B et al., 2015).  Also active against Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV-1 and HSV-2) (Yasin et al., 2000). In addition, it also has antibiofilmB activity of MRSA (Mataraci and Dosler, 2012).Antimicrobial robustness:  KCl-insensitive:E. coli: 100 mM salt.Surface immobilized peptide: Interestingly, immobilization of the peptide (immobilized) onto quantum dots (QDs) enhanced peptide activity and decreased toxicity (Galdiero et al., 2016).Structure:You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure in DPC micellesherein the PDB. The structure is also determined in SDS micelles (PDB ID: 1G8C).Animal model:mouse:  Indolicidin showed efficacy in mice (Ghiselli R et al 2008 Crit Care Med 36: 240-5).Animal model:mouse: XDR K. pneumoniae 325016 infected pneumonia mouse model, neutropenic mice, intratracheal i.t./i.p. (2,12h), 99% bacterial reduction in lung (Wang et al., 2025).Clinical trials: more info needed.Updated 6/2015; 12/2015; 9/2016; 11/2017; 10/2020; 7/2021; 7/2023; 12/2024; 3/2025",
