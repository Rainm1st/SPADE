  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "The N-terminus of the peptide is blocked by pyroglutamate. This is the first finding of a plant antifungal peptide with a five-disulfide motif. The five S-S bonds are C1-C5, C2-C9, C3-C6, C4-C7, and C8-C10. EAFP1 and EAFP2 show characteristics of hevein domain and exhibit chitin-binding properties similar to the previously identified hevein-like peptides. They exhibit relatively broad spectra of antifungal activities against eight pathogenic fungi from cotton, wheat, potato, tomato and tobacco.",
