    "Literature": "Eluted only by 35% isopropanol on reverse HPLC.Activity: Purified LS2 was shown to be active against Gram-positive L. lactis subsp. lactis BGMN1-596, L. lactis subsp.cremoris NS1, L.paracasei subsp. paracasei BGBUK2-8 (inactive) and L. innocua ATCC 33090. no MIC value. Note that the strain Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1 exhibits a wide antimicrobial spectrum against numerous strains (see ref. Table 2).Synergy:others: However, this broad spectrum could result from synergistic effect of its bacteriocins and the lactic acid which, in addition to the general antimicrobial effects exhibited by lowering the pH, can permeabilise the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and make them more vulnerable to the effects of bacteriocins.Peptide stability:  It is small and heat-stable.Provided by authors 7/2012; updated 7/2021",
