    "Literature": "Chemical modification:  Mostly C-terminally amidated. There is an intermolecular disulfide bond as well.Activity: On the weight basis, the monomer and dimer are equally active. radial diÂ¡usion assays: active against Gram- E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Gram+ bacteria L. monocytogenes, S. aureus.Antimicrobial robustness:   NaCl-sensitive:E. coli (100 mM), NaCl-sensitive:P. aeruginosa (100 mM), NaCl-sensitive:L. monocytogenes (100 mM), NaCl-sensitive:S. aureus (100 mM).Structure:   Either the monomer or dimer is helical in the presence of membrane-mimetic TFE or SDS. It's speculated that the peptide may have two conformations as evidenced by the two peaks on HPLC.In vitro toxicity: hRBC: While the monomer is not hemolytic at 100 ug/ml, the native dimer lyzed 21%.SAR: the peptide is two fold less active without amidation.
