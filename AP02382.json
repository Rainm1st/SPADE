  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Chemical modification: E is a methoxy-Glu (esterized). The N-terminal C14 fatty acid is a 3-hydroxy-11-methyltridecanoic acid (HTDA).Variant: In the case of Gageotetrin C, the N-terminal C14 fatty acid is a 3-hydroxy-8,10-dimethyldodecanoic acid (HDDA).Activity: They are more active against fungi compared to bacteria. Inhibited S. aureus (MIC 0.04 uM), B. subtilis (MIC 0.02-0.04 uM), S. typhi (MIC 0.02 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 0.02-0.04 uM), R. solani (MIC 0.02 uM), C. acutatum (MIC 0.01-0.02 uM), B. cinera (MIC 0.01 uM). In addiiton, gageotetrins B and C displayed good time course motility inhibition and lytic activity against the late blight pathogen P. capsici, which causes enormous economic damage in cucumber, pepper, tomato and beans, at 0.02 uM.Toxicity: not toxic to numerous human cancer cells at 30 ug/ml.
