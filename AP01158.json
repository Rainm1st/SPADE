    "Literature": "Active against S. aureus, S. typhimurium, E. coli, and C. albicans. Substantial antimicrobial activity remained when RP-1 or RP-11 was placed into whole blood or plasma 2 h prior to E. coli inoculation. These results suggest that the peptides were not rapidly inactivated within these biomatrices. Collectively, these findings support the concept that synthetic peptides can be designed to exert potent antimicrobial activities in relevant and complex biological matrices.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure bound to SDS micellesherein the PDB.
