    "Literature": "Antibacterial activity requires both chain a (PlnA) and chain b (PlnB). The sequence of chain a and chain b, however, are essential identical with the only difference being one additional Ala at the N-terminus of chain b.Activity: Active against P. pentosaceus Pac 1.0 (MIC 100 nM), L.  plantarum 965 (MIC 300 nM), L. casei subsp. casei NCDO 161 (MIC 250 nM), L. sake NCDO 2714 (MIC 60 nM), and L. viridescens NCDO 1655 (MIC 20 nM).Structure: The peptide is disordered in water but became helical in membranes. The 3D structure of chain a in DPC micelles has been determined by NMR spectroscopy (J Biol Chem. 2005 Jun 17;280(24):22945-50).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.  The helical region (residues 12-21) are good for membrane targeting as well as the pheromone/hormone function. Ref for anticancer effect is here: S.L. Sand, T.M. Haug, J. Nissen-Meyer, O. Sand, The bacterial peptide pheromone plantaricin A permeabilizes cancerous, but not normal, rat pituitary cells and differentiates between the outer and inner membrane leaflet, J. Membr. Biol. 216 (2007) 61â€“71.Discovery: Found in multiple species.SAR:  The N-terminal KSS segment is missing in PlnA 23mer, while the N-terminal KSSA is absent in  PlnA 22mer. The 22mer showed a similar activity spectrum with reduced activity in certain cases. Updated 8/2010; 3/2013; 2/2014; 3/2016; 7/2021 GW.",
