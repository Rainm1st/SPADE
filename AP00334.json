    "Literature": "Human neutrophil Cathepsin G is a chymotrypsin-like protease which also possesses antimicrobial activity. Antimicrobial activity is independent of the protease activity. Protease digestion of cathepsin revealed antibacterial fragments. This entry is one of them.  This peptide is active against S. aureus and N. gonorrhoeae. The orginal entry was replaced 9/2014; 9/2024.",
