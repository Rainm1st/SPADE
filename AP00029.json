    "Literature": "Structure:  Lysine rich (41.2%). Alpha helix 5 to 13 in DPC micelles.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. CAMEL (seq: KWKLFKKIGAVLKVL) is also a hybrid peptide obtained by combining residues 1-7 of cecropin (CA) and residues 2-9 of melittin (M). D-form tends to more active and more stable than the L-form (D>L). Transgenic plants: expression of this peptide in tobacco or potato led to disease-resistant plants against bacteria and fungi (ref). Another hybrid CA(1-8)M(1-18) is active against P. falciparum.",
