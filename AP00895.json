  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Rich in lysines (35%).Activity: Active against E. cloacae (MIC 1-25 ug/ml), E. aerogenes (MIC 4-6.25 ug/ml), E. coli (MIC 6-20 ug/ml), S. aureus (MIC 4 ug/ml), K. pneumoniae (3.1-6.2 ug/ml), E. faecalis ATCC 29212 (25 ug/ml), H. influenzae (MIC 3.1 ug/ml), and P. aeruginosa (MIC 6.25-12.5 ug/ml). fungi: C.albicans (MIC >200 ug/ml).Structure: Predicted to be helical based on the known structure of human LL-37. OH-CATH30 is obtained by removing the N-terminal 4 residues.Derivatives: OH-CM6 is obtained by further shortening OH-CATH30 by deleting the C-terminal 10 residues followed by mutations. These derivatives are active against indicator and resistant bacterial strains (MIC in the range of 1.5-25 ug/ml). Activity is reduced in the presence of serum. However, the D-form is stable for at least 12 h. These peptides appear to work on membranes as indicated by rapid killing in 60 min (2XMIC) and dye leakage.
