    "Literature": "Activity: Active against B. subtilis and S. aureus (MIC 15 ug/ml). Also, E. coli ML-35 (MIC 32-64 uM), S. aureus (MIC 4 uM), S. epidermidis (MIC 8 uM), and B. subtilis (MIC 4 uM).In vitro toxicity: It has a poor hemo.lytic activity.Structure:  It adopted a helical conformation in 50% TFE (Wang et al. 2011 Toxicol, 288 (1-3), 27-33).MOA:bacteria: It is proposed to target bacterial membranes (Wang K et al.AAC2012). A mutation of residue Ser11 to Gly11 converts the peptide toProtonectin, which is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.Updated 7/2011;4/12; 9/2012; Jan2020; 8/2024",
