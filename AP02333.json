    "Literature": "This head-to-tail cyclic peptide is likely synthesized by a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) since F4, L5, A7 and I8 are all D-amino acids.Activity: Active against C. glabrata and E. amylovora (at 25 uM). E. amylovora is responsible for Fire blight (fireblight) that is a contagious disease affecting apples, pears, etc.",
