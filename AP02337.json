  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Has ribonuclease activity 125 fold stronger than RNase 3 (Gullbery U et al., 1986).  It is antiparasital against microfilariae of Brugia pahangi and Brugia malayi  (see the ref). Active against extracellular virions of the single-stranded RNA virus respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Domachowske JB et al., 1998). RNase 2 is also selectively chemotactic for dendritic cells (DCs) (Yang et al., 2003).  In addition to the structure in the PDB link, there are numerous crystal structure in complex with ligands, shedding light on its binding mechanism of nucleotides.You can rotate, zoom, and view the crystal structure 2BZZherein the PDB.",
