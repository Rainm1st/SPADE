  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: the peptide was predicted but made in a different way.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (44.44%) toCr-ACP1Chemical modification: 3-aminotetradecanoic acid is attached to the N-terminus of the peptide. The amide on the fatty acid chain is then formed an amide bond with the C-terminus of the peptide. Residues L1 and T2 are D-amino acids (XXD2).Activity: active against B. subtilis 168 1A1 (MIC 8 ug/ml), E. faecium Com15 (MIC 8 ug/ml), S. aureus USA300 (MIC 4 ug/ml), E-coli DH5alpha (MIC>64 ug/ml), K-pneumoniae ATCC 10031 (MIC>64 ug/ml), A-baumannii ATCC 17978 (MIC>64 ug/ml), P-aeruginosa PAO1 (MIC>64 ug/ml), E-cloacae ATCC 14037 (MIC>64 ug/ml), M-tuberculosis H37RV (MIC>12.5 ug/ml).",
