    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: 44.44% similar to AP1534 (Temporin-SHf). F: 43%; H: 43%; L: 14%. In the sequence of the natural plicatamide, the C-terminus of the peptide is attached to decarboxy-(E)-alpha,beta-dehydro-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa).Activity: The native peptide had activity against Gram-positive S. aureus and L. monocytogenes. However, the native form appeared to be 2-3 fold more active against Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli and P. aeruginosa.Toxicity: The native form is also hemolytic. \nInterestingly, another two natural compounds, 5-S-GAD (Leem JY et al. 1996 J Biol Chem 271: 13573-77)  and halocyamine A (Azumi K et al 1990 Biochemistry 29: 159-65), also possess the DOPA unit. \n Updated 9/2017, 10/2020; 3/2023",
