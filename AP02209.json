Provided by Adel Ghorani-Azam and Ahmad Asoodeh.In 2016, the same sequence was also reported byChen X et al., 2016as temporin-1Re from the skin secretion of the European edible frog, Pelophylax kl. esculentus. This is a C-terminally amidated form. Found in multiple species. Updated 6/2016; 7/2021.",
