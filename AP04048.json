    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (97.3%) toColeoptericinG: 18%. GRAVY: -1.27; mol Wt: 8139.955; mol formula: C359H555N107O106; mol ex coeff: 23690.Activity: active against E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 32 uM), K. pneumoniae CAU202084 (MIC 32 uM),  S. aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC 64 uM),  and S. haemolyticus CAU202078 (MIC 32 uM).SAR: Compared to the WT (AP00413), there are two aa changes: Q20K and R74W. These changes would make the peptide more active.Resistance development:no:bacteria:E. coli: Resistance development:no:bacteria:S. aureus ATCC 25923;  Resistance development:no:bacteria:K. pneumoniae;  Resistance development:no:bacteria:S. haemolyticus:: MIC to the four bacteria did not increase after 50 cycles (cf: gentamicin MIC > 128 ug/ml, MIC changed over 32-128 fold).MOA:bacteria: act on membranes. permeabilization.Toxicity: not toxic to RBC (not hemo.lytic) or vero cells at 128 uM.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: expressed as a GST fusion, purified by GSTrap 4B, PreScission Protease cleavage, further purified by Superdex 30.Animal model:mouse: challenge with K. pneumoniae CAU202084 for 27 h caused mastitis and treatment with the peptide or  gentamicin effectively reduced\nneutrophil infiltration and alleviated the thickening of acinar walls. CFU reduced ~1 log. In addition, both TNF-alpha and IL-1beta reduced in the peptide treated group relative to the infected group (Anti-inflammatory).",
