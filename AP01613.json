  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Predominantly active against the intestinal pathogens S. typhimurium and L. monocytogenes. The isolated peptide is two residues longer at the N-terminus than predicted in silico. AvBD11 presents in different compartments of hen egg (e.g. egg white). In hen vagina, the levels of AvBD 3, 5, 10, 11, and 12 increased in response to LPS treatment.  It is predicted to form six S-S bonds, which can form a double beta-defensin motif. Very active against E. coli at a MIC 50 nM. The net charge does not correlate with antibacterial activity.
