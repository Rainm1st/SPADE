    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (53.85%) tosynthetic K11K: 23%: L=T: 15%. GRAVY: 0.31; M Wt: 2872.554; Mol formula: C137H236N33O33; molar extinction coeff: 5550.Activity: active against P. aeruginosa PAO1 and mutants (MIC 2-4 ug/ml), E. coli UB1005 (MIC 0.5 ug/ml), and S. typhimurium 14028s (MIC 2 ug/ml). Also active against Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 25923 or SAP0017 MRSA (MIC 8 ug/ml), S. haemolyticus (MIC 8-16 uM), S. epidermidis (MIC 16 ug/ml), E. faecalis ATCC 29212 (MIC 64 ug/ml), L. monocytogenes NCTC 7973 (MIC 4 ug/ml), S. pyogenes ATCC 19615 (MIC 8 ug/ml), and C. xerosis lab strain (MIC 2 ug/ml) (Friedrich et al., 2000).Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-insensitive:P. aeruginosa 100-300 mM; MgCl2-sensitive:P. aeruginosa MIC increased from 4 ug/ml (1 mM) to 32 ug/ml (5 mM); sodium alginate-sensitive: MIC increased from 2 ug/ml (0.01%) to 32 ug/ml (0.1%). Also: KCl-insensitive:E. coli: 100 mM salt. Provided by Arjun Nair.",
