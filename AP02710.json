    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE is similar to (61.11%)SMAP-29I: 33%, K22%, R: 17%. This peptide was designed based on  SMAP-18 by converting residues 1 and 2 to K and N and residues 6, 7, 11, 13, 14, and 28 to I, and adding an amine to the C-terminal G. Isoleucine 34%, K+R 30%.Activity: Active against M. haemolytica serovar (MIC 3.8 ug/ml), P. trehalosi serovar 4 (MIC 10 ug/ml), S. enterica subsp. arizonae (MIC 6.7 ug/ml), P. multocida (MIC 8.3 ug/ml), K. pneumoniae (MIC 1.3 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa PAO1 (MIC 4.2 ug/ml), and S. aureus (MIC 5 ug/ml).Antimicrobial robustness: It retains activity in the presence of moderate to high salt levels (salt-insensitive).Toxicity:  This peptide is 100% hemolytic at the tested concentration(what is it?), while the derivatives (e.g. OV-3, seq KNLRRITRKIIHIIKKYG) are less toxic.Structure: Its 3D structure of the N-terminal 18 residues (OV-3) has been determined by NMR. residues 4-16 are helical.You can rotate, zoom, and view one of the 3D structuresherein the PDB. In addition, 15N-solid-state NMR determines that a shorter peptide OV-3 is oriented parallel to the palce of the lipid bilayer (Yamaguchi et al., 2001).Replaced 5/2019; 2/2020; 7/2021; 2/2024 seq updated",
