    "Literature": "AMP Significance: amyloid AMPs:The discovery of antimicrobial property of this peptide adds a new avenue to understanding the mechanism of the Alzhermer's disease.Activity: It also inhibits  Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) (Bourgade K et al., 2014). H4 neuroglioma cells produced A-beta42 in response to HSV-1 infection thus inhibiting secondary replication (Bourgade K et al., 2016). It also inhibits influenza A virus (White et al. 2014).Animal model:mouse:  The antimicrobial role of this peptide has also been demonstrated in a mouse model. Salmonella typhimurium bacterial infection of the brains of transgenic 5XFAD mice caused rapid seeding and accelerated beta-amyloid deposition, which closely colocalized with the invading bacteria. Thus, it is possible that beta-amyloid plays a protective role in innate immunity and infectious or sterile inflammatory stimuli may drive amyloidosis (Kumar et al., 2016).Therapeutic strategy: LL-37 can prevent amyloid formation ia a dose-dependent sequence-specific manner. Co-expression of human cathelicidin LL-37 with Abeta-42 in a transgenic Drosophila Model of Alzheimer's Disease reduced the Deleterious Effects of Amyloid-beta42 (Cell Press Publihser).Updated 11/2014; 3/2018; 2/2024.",
