    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (97.44%) tohuman ALL-38The predicted form differs from ALL-38 by one residue and from LL-37 by two residues at the N-terminus. I: 8%, L:10%, F: 13%, K: 15%, R: 13%.  GRAVY: -0.569; M Wt: 4711.568; Mol formula: C217H355N61O55; Mol ex coeff: 0.Activity: inhibition zone assay: Active against E. coli and B. megaterium. Also active against  uropathogenic\nmicroorganisms E. coli (MIC 25 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 12.5 uM), K. pneumoniae (MIC 50 uM), P.mirablis (MIC> 100 uM), E.faecalis (MIC> 100 uM), and S.epidermidis (MIC> 100 uM). Lactobacilli strains are resistant to this peptide L.rhamnosus GR-1  (MIC> 100 uM), L.rhamnosus 81  (MIC> 100 uM), L.plantarum RC-20  (MIC> 100 uM) and L.fermentum RC-14  (MIC> 100 uM) (Smeianov et al., 2000).Structure: random coil in water and helical in 2% of 50 times concentrated medium E.Toxicity: did not appear to be hemo.lytic. Not toxic to human peripheral blood lymphocytes at 10 uM.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli expression system, expressed peptide was active (Feng et al., 2003).SAR: Recombinantly expressed peptides with a change of Q24 or N32 to K increased peptide antibacterial activity (against E. coli ATCC 25922, E. coli ML35p, and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853) and hemolysis (Yang et al., 2004).Updated 7/2024",
