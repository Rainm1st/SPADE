Active against S. aureus (MIC 13-29ug/ml), C. albicans (MIC 11.5-26ug/ml) and N. gonorrheae (MIC 51-103ug/ml).It also showed activities against P. falciparum (antimalarial) as well as human sperm.Inhibited zika virus (Haddad  et al., 2024).SAR: The N-terminal region is responsible for both oligomerization and hemolytic activity.Derivatives: NMR structures of two derivatives have been solved [2DD6for K4-S4(1-13) and2DCXfor NC12-K4S4(1-13)].Structure: The 3D structures remain the same.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 2DD6 structureherein the PDB.Update: Sequence has been corrected based on the original paper. 3/2015 GW; 4/2019 C Wang; Updated 5/2020 GW.",
