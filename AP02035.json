    "Literature": "Activity: Active against fungi. Said active but not clear to what bacteria and fungi.Sequence analysis: Interestingly, this peptide contains four repeated segments with the four-cysteine motif C-X-X-X-C-(10Â±12)X-C-X-X-X-C that is present in the MiAMP2 protein. Similar proteins in different plants can have a variable number of such repeating motifs (see Fig 4 of this ref).No activity was found for MiAMP2a. Updated 5/2017.",
