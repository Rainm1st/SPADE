    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide most resembles (38.6% similarity)Omwaprin. The recombinant protein showed activity against Gram+ bacteria but not Gram- bacteria. Active against A. viridans, M. luteus (MIC 1.56-6.25 uM), S. aureus and B. megaterium (MIC 12.5-50 uM).",
