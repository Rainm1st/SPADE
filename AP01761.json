    "Literature": "Chemical modification:  Glycosylation occurs at both Ser and Cys (modified by an N-acetylglucosamine beta-O-linked to Ser18, and an N-acetylhexosamine S-linked to C-terminal Cys43). There are two disulfide bonds: C5-C28 and C12-C21.Activity: incubation with 200 nM GccF for 5 h resulted in only 5% cell death of L. plantarum (ATCC 8014 cultures). Rather, purified GccF caused rapid and sustained bacteriostasis (IC50 ~2 nM).Structure: Helical based on CD.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.SAR: A change of the alpha-proton of Ser18 to methyl led to an activity drop by 1000 fold. Structural analysis revealed a marked difference in the orientation and mobility of the loop, as well as a markedly different positioning of the GlcNAc, thereby altering its interaction with a yet unknown target nolecule (Harjes et al. 2023).
