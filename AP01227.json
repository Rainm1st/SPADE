  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery:  Escherichia coli TldD and TldE interact to form a heterodimeric metalloprotease. TldD/E cleaves the N-terminal leader sequence from the modified MccB17 precursor peptide to yield the mature antibiotic, while it has no effect on the unmodified peptide (Ghilarov D et al., 2017). Extracted by boiling bacteria in 100 mM acetic acid, 1 mM EDTA, and purified to homogeneity in one step by HPLC.Chemical modification:  Mature peptide carries four oxazole and four thiazole rings derived from unusual post-translational modifications of six glycines, four serines, and four cysteines spanning residues 39-66 of the MccB17 precursor (Yorgey P et al., 1994).Sequence analysis:  G: 60%, S: 14%.Activity: Active against E. coli.MOA:bacteria:E. coli: Escherichia coli sbmA can recognize perhaps the thiazole rings to internalize the peptide which targets DNA gyrase. MccB17 is the first known DNA gyrase inhibitor of peptidic nature (Viz√°n JL et al., 1991).Resistance mechanism: a single change of DNA gyrase Trp751 to Arg reduced the binding of the antibiotic to DNA gyrase.SAR: Synthetic peptides without the N-terminal Glycine-rich domain strongly stabilize the gyrase-DNA cleavage complex with increased potency. However, the truncated peptides are less antimicrobial, suggesting a role of the N-terminal sequence for cellular uptake (Thompson RE et al., 2014).Updated 11/2017; Jan2025.",
