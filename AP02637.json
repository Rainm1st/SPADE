  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide most resembles (38.5% similarity)Brevinin-1SN1. Identified from an animal regarded as a model for the ancestor of all vertebrates. Active against E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 6.3 ug/ml), V. anguillarum ATCC 43308, S. aureus ATCC 25923, and M. luteus ATCC 49732 (MIC 6.3-12.5 ug/ml). It showed no hemolysis of hRBCs at 100 ug/ml.  Helical in the presence of SDS or 50% TFE. It binds to LPS or LTA. The peptide is able to permeate bacterial membranes.",
