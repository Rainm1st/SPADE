    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE shows 50.4% similarity tohuman lysozyme. First sequenced byYu and Irwin, 1996.Activity: This study shows activity against S. aureus ATCC 25923, E. coli ATCC 10798, E. coli ATCC 25922, and P. aeruginosa ATCC 15442. Trypsin digestion identified two active peptides: LP (seqeuence GVSLANWVCLAK) and SP (sequence AWVAWK against G- bacteria). Fusing SP with the native sequence enhanced the lysozyme activitiy.",
