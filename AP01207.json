    "Literature": "Discovery: A RTD-like theta-defensin derived from human pseudogenes.Derivatives: RC-101 (seq: GICRCICGKGICRCICGR) is obtained by changing R9 to K9 to facilitate chrorophore-labeling. RC-111 has the same amino acid sequence as RC-100 and is also cyclic, but its residues are placed in reverse order along the peptide's backbone. RC-111ox, an acyclic variant of RC-111 with a beta-hairpin structure, also inhibited HIV-1 infection, but did so less effectively than cyclic RC-111 (AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 2007; 23:508-14). RC-112 is composed exclusively of D-amino acids, whereas retrocyclin-1 contains only L-amino acids. RC-112 is more active than retrocyclin-1 against HIV, probably owing to higher stability to proteases (J Pept Res. 2004 Jun;63(6):469-76).MOA:virus:  It binds to gp120 and CD4, thereby inhibiting HIV entry (Wang W J Immunol 2004; 173:515-520).Peptide formulation: Formulated RC-101 microbicide was safe and virus-active in pigtailed macaques model (PLoS One. 2010 Nov 29;5(11):e15111).
