    "Literature": "First characterized example of an N- and C-end circular bacteriocin. Active against Gram-positive Bacillus, Staphylococcus (S. aureus, MRSA), and Listeria and Gram-negative Salmonella, E. coli, etc. Also anti-parasitic against T. brucei with an EC50 = 1-3 nM by targeting intracellular compartments (Martínez-García M1,  et al. 2018).Monomer at acidic pH but a dimer at physiological pH. The NMR structure consists of five helices in a globular fold. In addition, three crystal structures in complex with different ligands have also been saved into PDB (IDs: 1O82; 1O83; 1O84) (see J Mol Biol 334: 541-549, 2003).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. Of note, the circular structure is required for structure and stability, but less essential for activity. The molecule might have already been perfectly designed by nature (Sanchez-Hidalgo M et al 2011 Cell Mol Life Sci 68:2845-57).  AS-48 is a good candidate as a natural food preservative. Enterocin 4 has the same sequence as enterocin AS-48, but the former is only active against Gram-positive bacteria (Joosten HM et al 1996 Appl Environ Microbiol 62, 4220-3). The equivalence between Bac21 and AS-48 has been further validated (Kirkpatrick et al., 2018). Updated 7/2011; 10/2011; 9/2012; 5/2013; 4/2018; 7/2018.",
