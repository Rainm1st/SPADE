    "Literature": "Activity: Active against Gram- P. aeruginosa PA01 (LD50 1.1 ug/ml), M. catarrhalis ATCC43627 (LD50 0.9 ug/ml), Gram+ S. pyogenes ATCC14289 (LD50 0.2 ug/ml), E. faecium 1438 (LD50 4.5 ug/ml), fungi C. albicans 90028 (LD50 25 ug/ml), and C. neoforman 96-1043 (LD50 80 ug/ml). Also active against E. coli (MIC 0.46 uM), S. coag. neg. spp (MIC 1.58 uM), Propionibacterium spp (MIC 5.23 uM), S. aureus (MIC 5.54 uM), and C. albicans (MIC 0.09 uM) (Data from Maerki C et al. 2009 J Immunol 182: 506-514). More active against bacteria than fungi.  This peptide also inhibits the formation of P. aeruginosa biofilms (Ramamourthy et al., 2019).  It is also active against parasite L. mexicana in vitro (SÃ¶birk SK et al 2013).Antimicrobial robustness:  antibacterial activity is salt-sensitive.Structure:   In 2008, the NMR structure was also published (Chan DI et al., 2008).
