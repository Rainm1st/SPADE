    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE poorly similar (38%) toplant Ib-AMP1.Activity: Active against S. aureus, L. monocytogenes, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae.SAR:  hLF(1–11), hLF(2–11), and hLF(3–11) displayed bactericidal activity against the various bacteria whereas hLF(5–11) was ineffective.  Thus, the first two arginines are essential for the bactericidal activity of hLF against these bacteria. In addition, hLF(1-11) is at least 10 times more potent than hLF(21-31), another cationic region of human lactoferrin.Surface immobilized peptide: hLF1-11 has been covalently immobilized 2014 to the titanium surface to reduces bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation (Godoy-Gallardo M et al., 2014).",
