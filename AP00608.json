    "Literature": "Discovery: a minimal AMP from parent cathelicidin LL-37 obtained by comparing a small library of small peptides with 10-13 amino acids. Mol Wt: ~1571.Activity: The peptide remained active against E. coli K12 (MIC 40 uM) but not S.aureus USA300 in TSB. It also reduced the viability of T. vaginalis on a 5-nitroimidazole-sensitive and a 5-nitroimidazole-resistant strain (Ram√≠rez-Ledesma et al., 2022).Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-sensitive:E. coli (100 mM).Toxicity:  It is poorly hemo.lytic to human cells (e.g. 2% hRBC): 10% hemolysis at 100 uM.Structure: The 3D structure of KR-12 was determined in the D8PG membrane model, a more relevant model than SDS. Helical for residues 3-12 (or residues 20-29 as in LL-37). The structure is also determined in SDS micelles (PDB ID: 2ZA3).Surface immobilized peptide: KR-12 has also been covalently immobilized 2016Nie et al.to the titanium surface.SAR: a change of either interfacial basic residues (R23 and K25) led to reduced helixity in complex with D8PG according to CD. A change of R23 to A increased peptide activity against E. coli.Peptide engineering: This minimal antibacterial peptide of LL-37 has been widely utlized to design novel peptides, ranging from linear to cyclic forms (Refer to a review, to be submitted). Stapled peptides with enhanced stability and activity have also been reported and the Q22-D26 staple gave optinmal results (Zhang et al., 2024).peptide formulation:Silica precipitation:KR12@Si: KR-12 is able to precipitate silica to form silica particles, allowing controlled release. The peptide retained its activity against E. coli, lost activity against P. aeruginosa, and became more active against S. aureus after forming silica particles (nanomaterial) (Ki et al., 2023).KR-12 review: Various constructs of KR-12 designed antimicrobial peptides can be readhere.Updated 7/2021; 7/2023; 2/2024; 7/2024; 10/2024",
