  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Peptide synthesis: a 26mer was made with C-terminal amidation (implied by last G).Activity: Active against E. coli ATCC 25922 ML-35 or D21 (MIC 0.5-1 uM), S. typhimurium ATCC 14028 (MIC 1-2 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 1 uM), S. marcescens ATCC 8100 (MIC 2 uM), S. aureus ATCC 25923 or Cowan 1 MRSA (MIC 2-4 uM), S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC 1 uM), B. megaterium Bm11 (MIC 2 uM), C. albicans (MIC 8 uM), and C. neoformans (MIC 4 uM). It also inhibited biofilm formation and could disrupt pre-formed biofilms of S. Typhimurium (Xia et al., 2024).Toxicity: HC50>100 uM to hRBC (3.5% hemolysis at 3 uM; 32.7% hemolysis at 100 uM), but not hemo.lytic to bovine RBC even at 100 uM. Thus, hemolysis is related to cell sources, indicating the need of protecting the host from lysis.Structure: its 3D structure has been determined.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.MOA:bacteria: BMAP-27 induces a rapid permeabilization of the inner bacterial membrane.SAR: The authors found that truncation of the C-terminal hydrophobic tail to generate BMAP27(1-18) improved peptide selectivity but had little effect on antimicrobial activity. BMAP-18 became indepedent in 2023.Updated 2/2009; 10/2019; 10/2021; 10/2023",
