  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "There are extensive post-translational modifications: T1, T4 and T8 are dehydrated into Dhb. The N-terminal Dhb was unstable and further oxidized by deamination into 2-oxo butyrate. In addition, thioether or methylthioether bonds occur between the following residue pairs: S11-C15, T17-C21, T20-C23, S24-C28, and S27-C31. Showed broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, as well as several pathogenic Candida species. Subtilomycin possesses several desirable industrial and pharmaceutical physicochemical properties, including activity over a wide pH range, thermal resistance and water solubility.
