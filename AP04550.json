    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (84.62%) toparent peptide BmKn2I=L=A: 18%.Activity: inhibited biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa weakly. Dose-dependent (200-800 uM) inhibited biofilm formation and disrupted biofilms.Antivirulence:bacteria:P. aeruginosa:  Also exerted inhibitory activity against pyocyanin production.Structure: predicted to be helical.In vitro toxicity: sheep RBC: not hemo.lytic. Low toxicity to L929 cells. \nUpdated 10/2024",
