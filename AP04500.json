  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: The leader peptide of AvdA was estimated to be 35 amino acids long by comparing with homologus circular peptides. Avidumicin could not be isolated and purified from the bacterial cuture.  Only some peptide fragments were made to test activity.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (44.78%) toEnterocin NKR-5-3BA: 31%, G: 12%, I=V=S: 10%. GRAVY: 1.04; Mol Wt: 5586.643; mol formula: C252H423N67O70S2; mol ex coeff: 11100.Activity:  122 bacteria were screened to identify strains that inhibited  antimicrobial-resistant C. acnes in acne patients.  Cu. avidum ATCC25577 and 89.7% of the Cu. avidum clinical isolates (26/29 strains) inhibited Cu. acnes growth. The anti-Cu. acnes activity was confirmed by cloning an identified gene cluster and chemically synthesized peptides (peptide 3). The anti-Cu. acnes activity of avidumicin was further confirmed by Lactococcus lactis MG1363 carrying avdA. Warning: the activity of purified whole peptide has not been tested.Structure:  alphafold2 predicted to have a helical fold similar to circular bacteriocin AS-48.SAR: three peptides were synthesized. Only peptide 3 (seq: AAAVATAKWAIKKWGKKVAIA) showed a weak activity (MIC 113 uM).",
