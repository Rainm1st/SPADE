    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (50%) toAcidocin LCHVV: 53%, P: 20%; L: 13%. GRAVY: 1.93; M Wt: 1571.024; Mol formula: C77H136N16O17; Mol ex coeff: 0.Activity: active against S. aureus TISTR 517 (MIC 2 ug/ml), MRSA isolate 142 (MIC 2 ug/ml), MRSA isolate 1096 (MIC 2 ug/ml), MRSA isolate 2468 (MIC 2 ug/ml).Antimicrobial robustness: Peptide P1 retained activty at pH 2 to 14, after autocalve, or in the presence of proteinase K, trypsin, or chynotrypsin.MOA: Peptide P1 can permeate bacterial membranes.Structure: helical in membrane-mimetic SDS micelles.Toxicity: human RBC: Peptide P1 is not hemo-lytic tll 32 ug/ml. It, however, caused more than 50% hemolysis at 64 ug/ml. Hence, the peptide is not toxic at its MIC (2 ug/ml).",
