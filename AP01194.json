    "Literature": "Discovery: produced by the food-grade organism Lactococcus lactis.Activity: at pH 7, Active against the food-borne pathogen L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, B. cereus (MIC 1.9â€“3.8 ug/ml), E. faecium (MIC 1.9-3.8 ug/ml) and E. faecalis (MIC 1.9-3.8 ug/ml) (Iancu et al., 2012).Synergy:AMPs: The two polypeptide chains work synergistically.Chemical modification: The unmodified aa sequence of chain A2 is TPATPAISILSAYISTNTCPTTKCTRAC.  The primary structures of both lacticin 3147 peptides were then fully assigned by use of multidimensional NMR spectroscopy, showing that lacticin 3147 A1 has a specific lanthionine bridging pattern which resembles the globular type-B lantibiotic mersacidin, whereas the A2 peptide is a member of the elongated type-A lantibiotic class. In addition, residue L-Ser9 in chain A1 was converted to D-Ala, while both residues L-Ser9 and L-Ser12 are converted to D-Ala residues in chain A2 (PNAS 2005; 102: 18584-18589). These D-amino acids are essential for antimicrobial activity of lacticin 3147.Structure: Also obtained by NMR were solution conformations of both lacticin 3147 peptides, indicating that A1 may adopt a conformation similar to that of mersacidin with multiple turns (some locked by thioether bonds) and that the A2 peptide adopts a alpha-helical structure in the middle with turns or extended structures at termini (see Fig. 7 in the ref).MOA:bacteria: When interacting with bacteria, chain A1 binds first to lipid II followed by the binding of chain A2, leading to pore (0.6 nm) formation. Cf. nisin can form a pore of the size of 2 nm (Nat Rev Drug Discov 2006; 5: 321-323).Animal model:cattle: Topical use of this peptide can prevent bovine mastitis after deliberate infection (Ryan MP et al. 1998). updated 7/2021; 10/2023",
