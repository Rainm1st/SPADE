    "Literature": "Discovery: proteomic study of secreted proteins.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (32.76%) toVicBacP=R: 14%, L: 11%. GRAVY: -0.75; Mol Wt: 6518.767; mol formula: C286H477N95O70S4; mol ex coeff: 11350. Poor similarity to known AMPs.Chemical modification: predicted two disulfide bonds: C1-C4 and C2-C3.Activity:  active against Gram+ S. aureus ATCC 25923 (MEC 21.50 ug/ml), L.monocytogenes (ATCC 19115 (MEC >200 ug/ml), Actinomyce isolated from clinical specimens (MEC 12.33 ug/ml), Gram- E.
