    "Literature": "Host expression: the peptide expression increases in response to LPS: 113-fold in intestine, 126-fold in gills, 159 fold in head kidney, 181-fold in heart, and 1284-fold in spleen.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is poorly similar (80.77%) toS. maximus hepcidin-1. C: 32%; S=K: 12%. GRAVY: 0.232; M Wt: 2809.438;  M formula: C115H182N34O32S8; mol ex coeff: 1990.Chemical modification:  4 disulfide bond formation.Activity: HEK-cell expressed hepcidin showed growth inhibition of P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and A. veronii. In addition, synthetic peptide showed some growth inhibition compared to the scarmbled sequence.Found in multiple species. It has the same amino acid sequence as cmHep (Channa maculata hepcidin) reported previously (Gong et al., 2014).",
