Oryzae (-), X. oryzae pv. Oryzicola (+++), R. solanacearum (+), X. campestris pv. Holcicola (-). Bacteriostatic.Antimicrobial robustness: slight decrease in activity with the increase in temperature >60oCToxicity: human RBC, 2.09% hemolysis at 1000 ug/ml (not hemo.lytic)Recombinant production:bacteria:Bacillus subtilis: the engineered liquid fermentation products were spray dried to power.plant treatment:tomato: The diluted solution of the fermented powder exerted an antimicrobial action by secreting antimicrobial protein.  AMP-containing filter paper (placed on tomato leaves) had good inhibitory effects and reduced fruit rot infected with B. cinerea compared to the control (empty vector).",
