    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (94.12%) toStigA6K: 24%, L=F: 18%, I: 12%.Activity: active against Gram- E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 2.34 uM), E. cloacae ATCC 13047 (MIC 9.38 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 1.17 uM), Gram+  S. aureus ATCC 29213 (MIC 2.34 uM), S. epidermidis ATCC 122225 (MIC 9.38 uM), E. faecalis ATCC 4028 (MIC 1.17 uM), yeasts C. albicans ATCC 90028 (MIC 4.69 uM), C. krusei ATCC 6258 (MIC 9.38 uM), and C. glabrata ATCC 90030 (MIC 9.38 uM). Also inhibited parasite T. cruzi (MIC 2.5 uM), more effective than its parent peptide.Structure:  random coil in water but helical in 20-70% TFE or 20 mM SDS.In vitro toxicity: human RBC: low levels (<50%) of hemolysis until 75 uM, while the parent peptide showed no hemolysis under the same condition. \nUpdated: seq corrected 10/2024",
