    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE shows 71.4% similarity tobacterial 2-chain Haloduracin. Because of this similarity, the connection patterns of sidechains are predicted to be similar (Chain A, FrcA: disulfide bond between C1-C8, lanthionine bridges between S7-C17, T18-C23, and T20-C27; Chain B: lanthionine bridges between T1-C8, T13-C17, S19-C23, T23-C26). In addition, T2, S4, S5, and T10 are dehydrated into Dha or Dhb. Formicin is unique as the chain A is much less hydrophobic but most positively charged than other similar chains; chain B contains a negative charge (sequence: TTPSSLPCGTLVTAVWCPSNACTSDC).Activity: Active against a broad spectrum of Gram+ bacteria (e.g., L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus; L. amylophilus; L. lactis; M. luteus; S. smutans), including clinical strains S. aureus, C. difficile, and L. monocytogenes.
