  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Synthetic peptide is active against B. cereus (MIC 12.5 ug/ml), E. coli (MIC 50 ug/ml), L. mesenteroides (MIC 25 uM), M. luteus (MIC 1.5 ug/ml), P. haemolytica (MIC 0.8 ug/ml), S. aureus (<100 ug/ml), and S. uberis (MIC 50 ug/ml).  In TFE, residues 1-14 of the peptide is helical with the C=terminal eight residues disordered (Brinkworth CS et al. Biopolymers. 2003 Oct;70(3):424-34).  It inhibits the production of nitric oxide by the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase at a micromolar concentration by binding to its regulatory protein, Ca2+ calmodulin, a protein known to recognize and bind amphipathic alpha-helices (Biopolymers. 2003;70:424-34).
