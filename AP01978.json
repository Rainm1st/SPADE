    "Literature": "Activity: Active against Gram+ bacteria S. aureus AB94004 or ATCC 25923 or MRSA P1386 (MIC 0.6 ug/ml); M. luteus AB93113 (MIC 8.0 ug/ml); B. subtilis AB91021 (MIC 5.0 ug/ml); B. thuringiensis AB92037 (MIC 12.5 ug/ml), S. epidermidis (MIC 2.5-5.0 ug/ml),  E. faecalis (MIC 10 ug/ml), E. faecium (MIC 10 ug/ml), Gram- bacteria E. coli (MIC 1.5 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa AB93066 and 5 more strains (MIC 21.3->100 ug/ml). It also showed bactericidal activity against 18 clinical isolates of N. gonorrhoeae (MIC50 6.9-27.6 uM) (Arpornsuwan et al., 2014) and 8 Salmonella clinical isolates (Mangmee et al. 2021).Kn2-7 and BmKn2 are also HIV inhibitory(Chen et al., 2012)and Enterovirus 71 (EV71).This natural peptide kills oral squamous cells carcinoma cell line (HSC-4; IC50 29 ug/ml) via apoptosis (Tong-ngam et al., 2015).  It also inhibited  metastatic (CHMp-5b) and non-metastatic (CHMp-13a) Canine Mammary Gland Tumor Cell Lines. MOA:cancer: It induced apoptosis through Bcl-2 and Bax expression (Panja et al., 2021).Structure: random coil in water but became helical in 70% TFE.In vitro toxicity:  human RBC, HC50 12.5 ug/ml, hemolytic.Peptide formulation:  incorporation into oxidized sodium alginate/aminated hyaluronic acid (OSA/AHA) hydrogel led to effective antimicrobial activity against E. coli and S. aureus (Liang et al., 2021).SAR: While deletions of 1 to 4 residues from the peptide (Kn2-1 to Kn2-6) reduced its activity against S. aureus, peptide Kn2-7 (changes of G3, A4, and S10 to cationic K/R) showed  increased activity due to an increase in cationicity. However, C-terminally truncated or cyclic BmKn2 lost activity against N. gonorrhoeae, indicating both the linear and intact sequence are important for peptide activity.seq Updated 5/2015; 7/2021; 5/2024",
