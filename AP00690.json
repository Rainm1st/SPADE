  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Prophenin (PF) and variants thereof are also found in organic extracts of porcine pulmonary tissue (Wang Y. et al. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 257). The major forms of PF found in these extracts by nano-ES mass spectrometry are the 80-residue polypeptides prophenin-2-Pyr (PF-2-Pyr) and prophenin-2-Gln (PF-2-Gln). Prophenin-2-Pyr is refractory to Edman degradation due to the presence of an N-terminal pyroglutamic residue. In PF-2-Gln the N-terminal residue is glutamine and the C-terminus is amidated.",
