  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Active against Bacteria E. coli (MIC 5 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 5 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 (MIC 5 uM), S. aureus (MRSA) (MIC 5 uM), A. baumannii (MIC 5 uM), and S. maltophilia (MIC < 10 uM) and fungi C. albicans ATCC 90028 (MIC 10 uM). This peptide stimulated insulin secretion from rat BRIN-BD11 clonal pancreatic ?-cells at concentrations greater than 0.3 nM without cytotoxicity by a mechanism involving membrane depolarization and increase of intracellular Ca2+ (Ojo et al., 2015), thereby of interest for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Note that the [L28K] and [C31K] analogues are more potent than the parent peptiude. A subsequent study of this group indicates that the peptide Esculentin-2CHA(1-30) retains the insulinotropic effect after removal of the rana box.Toxicity: less hemo.lytic (hRBC HC50=150 uM).
