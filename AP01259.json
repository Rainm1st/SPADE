    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis revealed sequence most similar (83.8%) toinsect Papiliocin.Recombinant production:yeast:Pichia pastoris: Recombinant peptide was found to be active against fungi A. niger (MIC 4 uM) and T. viride.Activity: Recombinant peptide expressed in (Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli (with one additional P at the N-terminus) is active against E. coli K12D31 (MIC 12 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 20 uM), Salmonella spp. (MIC 14-16 uM), fungi P. chrysogenum (MIC 22 uM), and G. saubinetii (Li et al., 2007). Tandem repeat expression has reached the high yield of 68 mg/L (21% in the soluble form) (Zhou et al., 2009). Active against Salmonella spp. (MIC 14 uM) and P. chrysogenum (MIC 18 uM). The recombinant form cleaved using hydroxylamine hydrochloride (with one additional Gly at the N-terminus) from the SUMO-mediated tandem expression system (48 mg/L) behaves very similarly to the native form (Chen et al., 2010).MOA: Act on membranes and binds to DNA in vitro (Zhang et al., 2008).Toxicity: It showed no toxicity to HEK-293 or PBMCs at 120 uM and not hemo.lytic at 200 uM. Anticancer cells (K562, U937, THP-1, SHG-44, HeLa, HepG2 at LC50 10-20 uM): the binding activity of ABP-CM4 to leukemia cells was much higher than that to HEK-293 or PBMCs (Chen et al., 2010).Structure: Helical in 50% TFE.  The results are summarized in a review (Li et al., 2012). The original Temporin-1PRb with MIC >100 uM was replaced 5/2020; updated 7/2021; 12/2022.",
