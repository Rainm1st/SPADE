Wt: 18770.679, and Mol ex coeff.: 18737.5.Expression: Challenge with LPS resulted in a marked increase in the expression of cfl1 in the liver, spleen, skin and intestine at 2 h post challenge.Activity:  Active against Gram- A. hydrophila (MIC50 1.75 uM) and the Gram+ S. aureus (MIC50 0.75 uM). MIC50=50% inhibition. Animal model:zebrafish: It also protects zebrafish embryos from  the attack by potential pathogenic A. hydrophila. Three fragments were found to be active: residues 9-25, 34-51, and 108-125.MOA:  it depolarizes membranes and induces high intracellular ROS. Est Jan2022",
