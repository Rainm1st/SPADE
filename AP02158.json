  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Human PF4  kills malaria parasites P. falciparum  inside erythrocytes by selectively lysing the parasite digestive vacuole (DV). hPF4 comprised three domains: an N-terminal chemokine\ndomain, a central domain responsible for homotetramerization, and a C-terminal amphipathic helical region with HDP activity (Yeaman et al., 2007). The C-terminal domain is responsible for antimicrobial activity. RP-1 was designed based on the C-terminal HDP domain (Yeaman MR, et al 2002).",
