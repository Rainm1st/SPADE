  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide most resembles (41.6% similarity)Hainanenin 1.  Mol. Wt:  2424.048; GRAVY=0.65.Activity: Active against M. abscessus subsp. massiliense (MIC 60.8 ug/ml).  Also active against S. aureus.MOA:bacteria: it might disrupt cell membranes.Animal model:mouse:  Polydim-I treatment at 2 mg/kg/mLW showed significant reduction of the bacterial load in all analyzed organs by up to 90% in the lungs and spleen. The data showing here are significant considering M. abscessus is the most drug-resistant mycobacterial species (anotherantibiotic nightmare).Structure: Subsequent characterization reveals membrane targeting and the formation of a largely helical conformation (Rangel M et al., 2017).
