    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (53.33%) toGNU7I:47%; R:20%; K=Q: 13%. Mol formula: C87H162N28O18; Mol Wt: 1888.418; Mol Ex Coeff:  0; GRAVY: 0.106.Activity: active against Gram+ B. subtilis (MIC 2 ug/ml), E. faecalis (MIC 2 ug/ml), E. faecium VRE (MIC 2 ug/ml) (anti-VRE. cf.: MIC of vancomycin >32 ug/ml), M. luteus (MIC 2 ug/ml), S. aureus or MRSA (MIC 2 ug/ml), Gram- E. coli (MIC 4 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa (MIC 2 ug/ml), S. typhimurium (MIC 4 ug/ml), fungi C. albicans (MIC 2 ug/ml), C. neoformans (MIC 2 ug/ml), and S. cerevisiae (MIC 4 ug/ml).Antimicrobial robustness: salt-sensitive; MIC increased 4-8 fold in the presence of 150 mM NaCl;  serum-sensitive: MIC increased 2-16 fold with 10% serum. GNU6: resistant to digestion by trypsin, aureolysin, and chymotrypsin after 12 h incubation.Toxicity: not hemo.lytic till 130 ug/ml. cell viability not reduced after 24 h treatment of HaCaT keratinocytes and BJ fibroblasts till 70 ug/ml.Structure: helical in 20 mM SDS.MOA: Caused damage to membranes via permeabilization.The original has been merged with AP00948.",
