    "Literature": "Activity: Active against fungi with or without chitin in the membranes. Active against B. cinerea (IC50 2 ug/ml), C. langenarium  (IC50 4 ug/ml), S. sclerotiorum  (IC50 3 ug/ml), F. oxysporum (IC50 2.5 ug/ml), S. cereÍisiae (IC50 8 ug/ml), R. solani (IC50 75 ug/ml), P. capsici (IC50 0.6 ug/ml), Pythium spp.  (IC50 2.5 ug/ml), and P. parasitica (IC50 2 ug/ml).  It also inhibited B. subtilis (IC50 20 ug/ml) but not E.coli, A.tumefaciens.Antimicrobial robustness: CaCl2-sensitive:B. cinerea (5 mM); CaCl2-sensitive:S. sclerotiorum (5 mM); CaCl2-sensitive:F. oxysporum (5 mM); CaCl2-sensitive:R. solani (5 mM); CaCl2-sensitive:P. capsici (5 mM);  CaCl2-sensitive:P. parasitica (5 mM); CaCl2-sensitive:S. cereÕisiae  (5 mM); antifungal activity was substantially reduced (IC50 >200 ug/ml) or even lost when mediam A was sipplemented with 5 mM CaCl2.Peptide stability: heat-stable after treatment at 80oC for 15 min. Lost antifungal activity at pH 2 (acidic pH) or addition of a reducing agents (e.g. DTT).Updated 4/2019; 11/2024; 12/2024. GW",
