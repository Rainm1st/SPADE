  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Weakly active against E. coli, B. subtilis, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus (MIC ~ 80 ug/ml). The antibacterial activity of this series of peptides is Cn-AMP1 > Cn-AMP2 > Cn-AMP3. Cn-AMP1 also displayed antifungal, anticancer, and immune modulating activity (Silva et al. 2012). In the presence of SDS, the peptide adopted a helical structure based on both CD and NMR (Santana MJ et al., 2015).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.
