    "Literature": "APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (39.47%) toDendrocinGRAVY: 0.22; Mol form: C174H288N48O40; Mol Wt: 3716.471; molar extinction coefficient: 12590.About this plant:  This plant with the vernacular name of Avishan-e-Shirazi (Shirazi thyme) in Iran is a valuableMedicinal and condimental plant. It has several traditional uses as an antiseptic, carminative, stimulant, diaphoretic, diuretic, anesthetic, anti-spasmodic and analgesic.Activity: active against S. aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC 8 ug/ml), E. coli ATTCC 25922 (MIC 4 ug/ml), resistant S. aureus ATCC43300 (resistant to methicillin MRSA and oxacillin), VRSA S. aureus (MIC 16 ug/ml), and E. coli ATTCC35218 (MIC 8 ug/ml).Antimicrobial robustness:  pH-sensitive: Activity is best at at pH 8-9 with a decrease at either high or low pH. Activity also reduced at high temperatures (90-100oC).Toxicity:  low hemo.lytic (HC50 >>128 ug/ml).Structure: predicted to be helical.",
