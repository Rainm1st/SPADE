  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Calcualted molecular weight of sequence before modification is 2633.147. Reported as a 2560 Da lantibiotic.Activity: Active against M. luteus ATCC10240 (MIC 4 uM), M. luteus GAB13 (MIC 16 uM), S. equisimilis ATCC12388 (64 uM), Corynebacterium spp GH17 (MIC 8 uM), S. pyogenes ATCC12344, S. pyogenes ATCC12384 (MIC 32 uM).MOA: When added to different growth phases of Micrococcus luteus culture, salivaricin 9 induced cell lysis.  The peptide appeared to disrupt bacterial membranes. This autoinduction capability was used to enhance salivaricin 9 production in liquid medium. The peptide remains active after treatment with  lyticase, catalase and certain detergents, but NOT proteinase K or peptidase.",
