    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (44.4%) tobacteria Plantaricin JLA-9.Chemical modification:  This is a unique peptide that forms a new class UCSS1c. Darobactin has an unusual structure with two fused rings that form post-translationally. There is an unusual ether bond that links C6 of aromatic W1 and beta-carbon of W3. A second carbon-carbon bond connects C7 of aromatic W3 and beta-carbon of basic K5.Activity: Active against P. aeruginosa PAO1, P. aeruginosa pmrB 523C>T, S. sonnei ATCC 25931, K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, K. pneumoniae ESBL JMI 1052654, E. coli ATCC 25922, E. coli AR350 (mcr-1), E. coli ESBL JMI 1043856, E. coli ATCC BAA-2340 (KPC), E. coli MG1655 +10% serum (all previous, MIC 2 ug/ml), K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 (SHV-18), K. pneumoniae ATCC BAA-1705 (KPC), E. coli MG1655, S. Typhimurium LT2 ATCC 19585 (MIC 4 ug/ml), M. catarrhalis ATCC 25238, A. baumannii ATCC 17978 (MIC 8 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa JMI 1045324 (MIC 16 uM), E. cloacae ATCC 13047 (MIC 32 ug/ml), and P. mirabilis KLE 2600 (MIC 64 ug/ml). Not active agains the Gram+ bacteria tested.Resistance mechanism:  Mutants that are resistant to darobactin map to BamA, an essential chaperone and translocator that folds outer membrane proteins.Animal model:mouse:  thigh: a single injection of 50 mg/kg or 3 injections (every 6 h) significantly reduced bacteria at 26 h. The peptide also protects animals from death.In vivo PK:mouse: 50 mg/kg:IP: peak level 94 ug/ml and Peptide half life in blood is 1 h.In vitro toxicity:  Interestingly, this peptide is not toxic to symbiotic gut bacteria, but ampicillin did. It is a potential lead.Updated 5/2024",
