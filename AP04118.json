    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (94.12%) toApi88P:35%; R: 24%; N: 12%.Chemical modification: N-terminal coupled with N,N,N=,N=-tetramethylguanidino group (Gu); warning: N-terminal ornithine is represented as K; C-terminal amidation. Compared to Api88, the C-terminal residue L was deleted.Activity:  active against E. coli BL21 AI (MIC 64 ug/ml).Half-life in vitro:serum:mouse: half life in  undiluted mouse serum: 152 min.SAR: Further C-terminal delection of R led to inactive Api88(1-16) (MIC > 128 ug/ml).Updated 11/2024",
