    "Literature": "Active against Gram- E. coli DH5alpha, E. coli DH1 (MIC 0.7-1 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 4.1 uM), Gram+ A. globiformis, B. subtilis (MIC 0.5-1.0 uM), yeasts P. pastoris (MIC 17 uM). The peptide is also inhibitory to dengue NS2B-NS3pro and virus replication in the infected cells (Rothan HA et al., 2014). Different from Ltc2a, residues 8-23 of Ltc1 forms a straight helix (Biochemistry 47: 3525-3533, 2008).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure bound to SDS micellesherein the PDB. In general, latarcins showed reduced antimicrobial activities in the presence of divalent cations such as CaCl2.Toxicity: Rabbit erythrocytes (20% lysis): 80 uM, HC50 > 100 uM, less hemolytic.
