  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Chemical modification: Warning: the sequence is a close mimic of the natural peptide antibiotic. In the natural form, there are multiple Dab (2,4-diaminobutanoic acid), which are represented here as lysines. The molecule is cyclic due to the formation of an amide bond between the amino group of Dab in position 4 and the carboxyl group of the C-terminus. Polymyxin B is very similar (90%) to colistin with a change of F6 to L6.Activity: Polymyxin B is anti-film of P. mirabilis (Liu MC et al., 2012).  It also has antifungal activity in vivo (Zhai and Lin 2013).Antimicrobial robustness:  KCl-insensitive:E. coli: 100 mM salt MIC 0.125 ug/ml, no change.Resistance mechanism: Bacteria have responding genes, and when knocked out, can reduce peptide MIC. Knock out lysX gene of C. pseudotuberculosis reduced the MIC substantially to 10 ug/ml (cf. 640 ug/ml with this gene) (Gill et al., 2023).Animal model:mouse: In thigh infection, antibacterial effect was well correlated with fAUC/MIC (R2 = 0.89). 2 log CFU was not achieved for any strain even at the highest MTD. There was no difference (P > 0.05) in antibacterial activity between polymyxin B and colistin with equimolar doses.In vivo PK:mice: t1/2 to be added (Landersdorfer  et al., 2018).AMPs in use: Polymyxin B is administered parenterally in its active form. Overall polymyxin B has superior clinical pharmacological properties compared with colistin or its prodrug (Nation et al. 2014). Updated 4/2018; 3/2020; 9/2023.",
