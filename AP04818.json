Rapid killing at 2xMIC. It binds to LPS.  inhibit biofilms:bacteria (S. aureus and E. coli); eradicate preformed biofilms:S. aureus.Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-insensitive:S. aureus; KCl-insensitive:S. aureus; NH4Cl-insensitive:S. aureus;  CaCl2-insensitive:S. aureus; MgCl2-insensitive:S. aureus; FeCl3-insensitive:S. aureus. NaCl-sensitive:E. coli; KCl-insensitive:E. coli; NH4Cl-insensitive:E. coli;  CaCl2-sensitive:E. coli; MgCl2-insensitive:E. coli; FeCl3-insensitive:E. coli. serum-insensitive:S. aureus (10% FBS);  serum-sensitive:E. coli (10% FBS).MOA:bacteria:  it permeated bacterial membranes of S. aureus MRSA. Also permeated the outer membranes of E. coli.Structure: random coils in 10 mM NH4Ac and helical in 50% TFE.In vitro toxicity: horse RBC: HC50 64 uM. It showed toxicity to both cancer and non-cancer cells.",
