  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "AMP significance: It is down-regulated in acne vulgaris patients (Al-Sudany et al., 2019). Biomarker: Upregulation of psoriasin/S100A7 correlates with clinical severity in patients with oral lichen planus (Stolte et al., 2024).Functions: A protein with multiple functions. Initially found to bind Ca2+ (Hoffmann HJ et al., 1994). It has chemotactic activity (Hoffmann HJ et al., 1994).Activity: It is later established as a major AMP from human skin. Active against E. coli. Zn2+ saturated peptide is less active.MOA:bacteria:E. coli: sequstration of zinc can be an important part of skin defense against E. coli.Structure:  A structure for a triple mutant has been solved.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. It is found that Sustained Secretion of the Antimicrobial Peptide S100A7 is Dependent on the Downregulation of Caspase-8 (Bhatt et al., 2019).
