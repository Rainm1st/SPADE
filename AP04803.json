    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (77.78%) toIK3L: 50%; K: 44%.Activity: active against S. aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC 4 uM), B. subtilis ATCC 23857 (MIC 2 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 (MIC 8 uM), E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC 8 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 4 uM), A. baumannii ATCC 19606 (MIC 4 uM).In vitro toxicity: hRBC: HC10 6.887 uM. HC50 32 uM. hemolytic. LC50 4-8 uM toxic to human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293T).Structure:  random coil in water and helical in 50% TFE. Helicity is length-dependent and longer peptides are more helical in the series.",
