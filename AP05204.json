  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Discovery: C-terminal fragment of bovine apelin, an endogenous ligand for the APJ receptor, which can serve as a coreceptor for some HIV and SIV strains to infect the brain-derived NP-2/CD4 cells.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar to (91.67%) topredicted human Apelin-36. R: 22%, P: 19%.Activity: inhibit HIV-1 infection (IC50 0.3 ug/ml).SAR: anti-HIV decreases with the decrease in the C-terminal peptide length. It's not clear even longer sequences will better inhibit HIV-1.",
