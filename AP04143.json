    "Literature": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (55.56%) tobacterial PE1F=L=K: 33%.Activity: active against S. aureus AB94004 or ATCC25923 or ATCC6538 (MIC 3.12 uM), E. coli AB94012 or ATCC25922 or  DH5alpha (MIC 3.13-6.25 uM), and P. aeruginosa ATCC9027 or PAO1 (MIC 5.28-10.56 uM). Also active against 13 strains C. candida  ATCC 10231 or CMCC 98001 or AY 93025 and clincal strains (MIC 15.5-61.9 uM).biofilms:fungi:C. albicans: It also inhibited biofilm formation. it also inhibited hyphal formation.MOA:fungi:C. albicans: damage membranes and nucleus. Increased ROS levels in cells. It caused cell neccrosis not apoptosis.Animal model:mouse: subcutaneous infection; skin abscesses; infected with C. albicans ATCC10231; 1h later the peptide was injected into the infected area on days 1, 2, and 3: day 7 found CFU drop by ~2 logs (Li et al., 2024).",
