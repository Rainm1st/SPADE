    "Literature": "MOA: TPP3 interacts with plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol(4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) to mediate membrane permeabilization. TPP3 forms an oligomer with PIP2 (or PI(4,5)P2) in vitro and has been crystallized.  It can also toxic to cancer cells U937 and induces plasma membrane blebs (Baxter AA et al., 2015).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. Updated 3/2015.",
