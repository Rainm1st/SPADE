Wt:   5206.225, and Mol ex coeff.: 3355 (cys-paired). 3 disulfide bonds: Cys1–Cys5, Cys2–Cys4, Cys3–Cys6.Activity:  In rich medium, active against E-coli ATCC 25922, or resistant clinical strains (MIC>64 uM),  S-aureus ATCC 25923, MRSA (MIC>64 uM),  S. pseudintermedius clinical strain, no resistance (MIC 16 uM), S. pseudintermedius clinical strain, methicillin resistant MRSA (MIC 8 uM), P-aeruginosa ATCC 27853, P-hauseri ATCC 13315, E-faecalis clinical isolate (MIC >64 uM), E. faecium clinical isolate (MIC 8 uM). The peptide can kill nearly all the tested Gram+ and - bacterial strains in a minimal medium, indicating that medium components might have deactivated the peptide. Reg. 11/2021",
