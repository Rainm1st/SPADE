    "Literature": "Chemical modification:  3 Disulphide bridges:7,32; 18,40; 22,42.Activity: Active against C. albicans and P. pastoris.MOA:fungi:: Similar to plant defensin RsAFP2 (also in structure), it interacts with glucosylceramide isolated from the membranes of yeast and soybean but not humans (J Biol Chem 2004; 279: 3900-3905).Transgenic plants: expression of this peptide in tobacco improves resistance to pathogens (Montesinos E 2007 FEMS Microbiol Lett 270, 1-11).SAR:  Based on sequence alignment with defensins from the insect family, residues K23 and R24 at the end of the helix of heliomicin were altered to leucines, leading to a gain in antibacterial activity due to the generation of an amphipathic helix.Structure:  It has an identical fold to the WT.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.
