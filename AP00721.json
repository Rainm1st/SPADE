    "Literature": "Refer to Bruix M et al. (1995) Biopolymers 36: 751-63. Solution structure was determined by NMR (Bruix M et al., 1993). It has a well-defined triple-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet (residues 1-6, 31-34, and 39-47), an alpha-helix (residues 16-28), and the corresponding connecting loops. Transgenic plants: expression of this peptide in tobacco improves resistance to pathogens (Montesinos E 2007 FEMS Microbiol Lett 270, 1-11). Updated 7/2016.",
