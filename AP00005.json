  "Literature Information": {
    "Literature": "Activity: Active against B. megatherium Bml 1 (MIC 11 uM), B. subtilis Bs11 (MIC 17 uM), and M. luteus Mill (MIC 20 uM) (provided by Chunfeng Wang).Host expression: Andropin is constitutively expressed in the adult male ejaculatory duct in response to mating not bacterial infection. Andropin is less fungicidal than the cecropins (Insect Biochem Mol Biol. 1999;29:965-72).AMP Significance: Along with other antimicrobial proteins, this peptide sterilizes the reproduction system of insects and protects sperms from being infected by bacteria (J Insect Physiol. 2001 Jun;47(6):617-622). Similarly, ceratotoxins are expressed in the female reproductive accesary glands and expressed during mating (see APD entries 414-417). Interestingly, a similar protecting antimicrobial peptide, ALL-38, exists in human genital systems (see APD entry 624). Updated 9/2017; 7/2021.",
